"""Deterministic caption timings for the Dispatch.

Whole-file whisper alignment drifted badly on the assembled VO. Fix: we
synthesized PER LINE, so each line's [start,end] on the timeline is exact
(from real audio duration, vo_lines.json). We align EACH short line clip
(2-7s, clean) with faster-whisper word_timestamps, offset by the known line
start, then map those timings onto our INTENDED script tokens via a difflib
alignment so caption TEXT is verbatim-correct and TIMINGS are forced-aligned.

Outputs:
  out/dispatch/audio/words.json  {"words":[{w,s,e,seg}], "speech_end","total","fps"}
  out/dispatch/captions.json     [{"text","start","end","seg"}] readable cues
