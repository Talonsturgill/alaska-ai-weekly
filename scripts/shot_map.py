"""Print what each shot's ART does against the VO lines that shot actually covers.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-06, cost a full render and most of a panel round).

`SSL` / `scene_start_line` decides which VO lines each shot covers. Scene components are
authored against a PARTICULAR mapping, and every timing inside them is a frame offset from
that shot's own start. Re-solve SSL, or insert one line into the script, and every shot
downstream is cutting to different words — and nothing says so. tsc is clean. build_scenes
runs. The render succeeds. The film is just about the wrong things.

What that looked like: a re-solve moved S4 from two lines to three. S4's art whipped to a
Fairbanks records room at 0.3s and the narration stayed on the Anchorage police chief for
ten more seconds. S2's tail lost its picture entirely — six seconds of a finished crane
holding on a price card while the VO described a city ordinance. Both were found by reading
geometry by hand, after the render.

The judgement "is this picture about this line" is not automatable. The MECHANICAL half is:
where the lines start, and where the scene's animation events fire. Those two columns side
by side make a mismatch obvious in one screen. A shot whose only events fire at 0.3s while
its second line starts at 5.4s has nothing happening for five seconds; a shot whose events
all sit in its first third has a dead tail. Both are visible here and neither is visible in
the source.

Events are parsed from `interpolate(f, [...])` in each scene component — the first and last
keyframe of each call, in seconds from the shot's own start. Reads only; changes nothing.
