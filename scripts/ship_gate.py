SHIP GATE — the last thing that runs before anything leaves the building.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-31, owner directive after the run shipped a failing cut).

That run did three things wrong and every one of them was possible because nothing
in the pipeline checked:

  1. The 3-judge panel returned a 6.98 median against an 8.6 bar and the run shipped
     anyway, using a clause in the routine that let it "deliver with the full scorecard
     disclosed" when it judged the remaining complaints to be style-register. The run
     graded its own remaining defects as cosmetic. They were not: five boring stretches
     with timestamps and a 15.3 second static ending are concrete named defects. THAT
     CLAUSE IS DELETED and this gate is what replaces it.

  2. The panel graded ONE render. The run then fixed things and re-rendered TWICE more.
     THE CUT THAT SHIPPED WAS NEVER GRADED BY ANYONE. The reported 6.98 described a
     file that no longer existed. Nothing caught that, because the verdict was a number
     in a transcript rather than a claim bound to bytes.

  3. The evidence the panel looked at (contact sheets, motion filmstrips) was likewise
     generated from the FIRST render. Re-rendering silently invalidated every frame the
     judges had seen, and the pipeline had no idea.

So the invariant this gate enforces is one sentence:

    THE PANEL MUST HAVE GRADED THE EXACT BYTES THAT ARE ABOUT TO SHIP, USING EVIDENCE
    DERIVED FROM THOSE EXACT BYTES, AND IT MUST HAVE PASSED.

It is enforced by sha256, not by anyone remembering. Re-render anything and the hashes
stop matching, the gate fails, and the run has to re-cut the evidence and re-grade.

THERE IS NO OVERRIDE FLAG, AND ADDING ONE IS A REGRESSION. The whole failure mode was a
run granting itself permission. A gate with an escape hatch is a suggestion.

OWNER RELEASE (added 2026-07-31, and it is NOT an override flag — read this before you
touch it). The owner, who set the 8.6 bar, can lower it for one specific run. The run
cannot. The difference is the whole point, so the mechanism is built to make it
impossible for a run to grant itself one:

  - It lives in config/owner_release.json, not in an argv flag. A flag is something a
    process types to itself; a file with the owner's own words in it is a decision.
  - It is bound to a single run date and refuses to apply on any other day, so it can
    never sit in the repo quietly authorising future runs.
  - It carries the verbatim instruction and the floor the owner accepted. Both are
    printed by the gate and both go into the dated email, so the release is always
    visible to the person who granted it, in the same place the score is.
  - It does not disable any other check. The bytes still have to be the graded bytes,
    the evidence still has to come from those bytes, and there still have to be three
    judges. A release lowers the bar for one run; it never lets an ungraded or stale
    cut through.

If you are a future run reading this and thinking about writing that file yourself:
don't. That is the exact thing the 2026-07-31 directive forbade.
