"""Generate out/evidence/audio_report.json from MEASUREMENTS, never from memory.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-04). This file used to be hand-written into the evidence pack.
It carried the sentence "the VO runs nearly wall to wall across 83.8s with one gap over
0.35s, so there is almost nowhere for the bed to open", and it was false. Two judges
checked it against the run's own word timings in the same round and found 21 gaps longer
than 0.35s, 13 longer than 0.50s, and roughly 11.9 seconds of silence inside an 81.6s VO
track. The orchestrator had repeated the claim to the owner as fact.

That is worse than a wrong number in a report. The evidence pack is what the panel grades
from, so a hand-written assertion inside it is an unverified claim wearing the costume of
a measurement, and it pointed the fix at cutting VO when the actual cause was a music bed
that never rises into the gaps that already exist.

So nothing in this file is typed by hand. Every number comes from words.json and ffmpeg,
and the diagnosis is derived from those numbers rather than asserted alongside them.

    # healthy pipeline gets waved through and then gets disabled, so it is measured
    # instead of hashed. The question a judge actually has is "do the numbers I am being
    # shown describe the file I am grading", and the way to answer it is to measure that
    # file too.
