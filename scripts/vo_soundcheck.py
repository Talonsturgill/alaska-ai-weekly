"""VO SOUND CHECK — the QC gate that enforces docs/craft/VO_DIRECTION.md on a
Gemini TTS take. Given a rendered wav and the intended SPOKEN script, it scores:

  1. word_accuracy  — ASR-transcribe (faster-whisper) and compare to the script.
                      Catches dropped/added words and the 500 "text instead of
                      audio" fallback. (1 - WER)
  2. no_leak        — the transcript must NOT contain any tag word or director's-
                      note word (e.g. "whispers", "director", "transcript"). Catches
                      vocalized-markup / notes-read-aloud failures.
  3. expressive     — pitch (f0) std-dev in semitones must clear a monotone floor.
                      A flat read is the robotic tell; this enforces tone fluctuation.
  4. duration       — within the target window (pace on target).
  5. loudness       — integrated LUFS within a broadcast-safe band.

Usage (single take):
  python scripts/vo_soundcheck.py --audio take.wav --script "the spoken words" [--json]
Programmatic:
  from vo_soundcheck import check, pick_best
  rep = check(wav_path, spoken_text, tags=[...])

    The script is always spelled out in words (VO_DIRECTION mandates it) and only the

    digits into the words a house script would have used. Getting that mapping wrong
    scores word errors against a take that said exactly the right sentence.

    It was wrong for two whole decades' worth of numbers (fixed 2026-08-05, measured on
    a 288-word probe). The rule was "two 2-digit groups" for everything from 1000 to
    2999, which is correct for 2024 ('twenty twenty four') and wrong for:

      2008  ->  gave 'twenty eight'.   House scripts write 'two thousand eight', and
                every Dispatch that cites a paper year hits this. The 2026-08-05 script
                said 'two thousand eight' and 'two thousand six'; both scored as errors.
      1,000 ->  gave 'ten hundred'. A round thousand is a QUANTITY, not a year, and this
                format puts a round thousand in almost every script ('about a thousand
                species a decade'). Three separate instances in one probe script.

    Those two bugs alone contributed most of a 0.074 WER against a 0.08 fail ceiling, so
    a clean take was one mishearing away from a spurious re-synth. At 288 words there are
    simply more numbers for it to happen to, which is why a latent bug became a blocker.

    take the passing one closest to target rather than the most expressive one.
