# 2026-08-12 "The Smallest Door": THIRTEEN shots (S1..S13 in video-engine/src/Ep0812.tsx)
# onto 20 VO lines. S1 L0 (the sill lands + the definition), S2 L1 (the agency nameplate +

# the low step), S4 L3 (the notice slides in + the chips go dark), S5 L4 (THE REHOOK, the money
# grew + EAGLE at full size + eligibility unchanged), S6 L5-L6 (the second gauge at 300,000 +
# the rail extending + the step tripling), S7 L7 (the page turns + the tall slot + its two
# facts), S8 L8 (THE SIGNATURE RISE, every AI dollar into one slot), S9 L9-L11 (ACT 3, the

# notice printing its own objections + the red stamp), S11 L14-L15 (THE DIP + one sheet + the
# warm side step), S12 L16-L17 (twelve slips sort + the two named asks + four over eight below),
# S13 L18-L19 (the verdict + the envelope closing + the button returning frame 1 inverted).
# Remapped 2026-08-12 for the round-2 VO recut: 20 lines became 17, so the old table's
# last entry (18) no longer exists and every index past 6 pointed at the wrong sentence.
# 13 shots, 17 lines. Each entry is the VO line a shot opens on; a shot holds until the
# next entry, so lines 9, 11, 13 and 15 are absorbed into the shot before them.
# S13 moved from line 16 to line 15 (2026-08-12, panel round 3). The thesis card lives in
# S13, but S13 opened on line 16 ("Applications close..."), so the film's two most important
# lines, "The institute isn't the mistake" at 97.76s and "Retiring the small Alaska door in
# the same notice is", were spoken while S12 was still holding the Nome and Alakanuk grid.
# All three judges measured the lag; one put it at six seconds, at the beat the whole piece
# turns on. The card now lands on the line it belongs to.

    ADDED 2026-08-02 after a panel judge caught both failure modes in one film. Forced
    alignment chunks cues by width, which is correct for timing and blind to sense, so it
    produced "70 ash layers out of 8" / "tubes, a record they call virtually" (a number torn
    off its unit) and "It's confident about Katmai, Fisher" / "Caldera and Emmons Lake,
    because" (a two-word proper noun split across cards). Both read as errors to a viewer,
    because the eye finishes the line before the next one arrives.

    The fix is a MERGE, never a re-time: when a cue ends on a dangling token, it absorbs the
    next cue and takes its end time. Timing stays exactly as aligned, so caption sync is
    untouched; only the grouping changes. Merging is capped so a cue can't grow past what
    fits on two lines at phone size.
