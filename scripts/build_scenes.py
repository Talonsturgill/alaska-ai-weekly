# 2026-08-12 "The Smallest Door": THIRTEEN shots (S1..S13 in video-engine/src/Ep0812.tsx)

# Remapped 2026-08-12 for the round-2 VO recut: 20 lines became 17, so the old table's
# last entry (18) no longer exists and every index past 6 pointed at the wrong sentence.
# 13 shots, 17 lines. Each entry is the VO line a shot opens on; a shot holds until the
# next entry, so lines 9, 11, 13 and 15 are absorbed into the shot before them.
# S13 moved from line 16 to line 15 (2026-08-12, panel round 3). The thesis card lives in
# S13, but S13 opened on line 16 ("Applications close..."), so the film's two most important
# lines, "The institute isn't the mistake" at 97.76s and "Retiring the small Alaska door in
# the same notice is", were spoken while S12 was still holding the Nome and Alakanuk grid.
# All three judges measured the lag; one put it at six seconds, at the beat the whole piece
# turns on. The card now lands on the line it belongs to.
# 2026-08-30 "The Model Made the Number": THIRTEEN shots (S1..S13 in
# video-engine/src/Ep0830.tsx) onto 15 VO lines. S1 L0 (drone and company estimate),
# S2 L1 (Kenai and the Evidence Column), S3 L2 (fleet, sorties and flares), S4 L3
# (temperature band and nominal mass), S5 L4 (seven radar features), S6 L5 (observed
# reflectivity versus company interpretation), S7 L6 (assumed background and 27 models),
# S8 L7 (company mean and about 19M), S9 L8 (model spread), S10 L9-L10 (radar altitude
# then the 87-second ground-record payoff), S11 L11 (SNOWIE precedent), S12 L12-L13
# (Rainmaker countercase and split verdict), S13 L14 (landing, number and measuring cup).
# 2026-09-01 "The Ceiling Was in the Measurement": FOURTEEN shots (S1..S14 in
# video-engine/src/Ep0901.tsx) onto 19 VO lines. S1 L0 (ceiling impact), S2 L1
# (Nature authorship), S3 L2 (Wind today and L1 distance), S4 L3-L4 (paired-minute
# field and changing signal), S5 L5 (uncertainty mechanics), S6 L6-L7 (simulated
# ceiling and calibration), S7 L8 (corrected linear relation), S8 L9-L10 (the test
# and the 15 boundary), S9 L11-L12 (extrapolated two-times result and unresolved
# later saturation), S10 L13-L14 (no operational AI tested and flexible-model
# warning), S11 L15 (general hazards with scope limits), S12 L16-L17 (moved ceiling,
# fixed evidence boundary), S14 L18 (button and loopback). The original combined
# projection/counterpoint shot held 17.9 seconds, beyond the 16-second oner ceiling,
# so the unresolved physical-saturation counterpoint opens its own shot at L12.

    """Re-chunk a WHOLE VO line by sense when any break inside it is illegal.

    THE KNOWN LIMIT THIS CLOSES (2026-08-13). _rebalance_cues merges a cue that ends on a
    dangling or number word into the next, and abandons the merge when the result is too wide,
    leaving the bad break exactly where it was. Its own comment admits it: "on this run
    'obligated about six' / 'million dollars' still splits ... the real fix is chunking by
    SENSE rather than by width". Two judges then found the same defect here, where
    "just under three hundred" / "twenty five thousand dollars" cut a figure in half on screen.

    A PAIRWISE fix cannot solve it either, and it is worth writing down why: the only legal
    two-way break in that pair lands at 77 characters, and the caption renderer fits ~35 per
    line over two lines and DROPS the rest, so a 77-character cue would silently lose words.
    The unit that has to be re-chunked is the whole line.

    So: if any break inside a segment is illegal, rebuild that segment's cues from its joined
    text, greedily filling to `limit` and backing off to the last legal boundary. Time is
    allocated across the new chunks in proportion to characters, inside the segment's existing
    start and end, which are anchored to the VO line -- so the line stays in sync with the shot
    even though the words inside it regroup. Segments with no illegal break are untouched."""

    ADDED 2026-08-02 after a panel judge caught both failure modes in one film. Forced
    alignment chunks cues by width, which is correct for timing and blind to sense, so it
    produced "70 ash layers out of 8" / "tubes, a record they call virtually" (a number torn
    off its unit) and "It's confident about Katmai, Fisher" / "Caldera and Emmons Lake,
    because" (a two-word proper noun split across cards). Both read as errors to a viewer,
    because the eye finishes the line before the next one arrives.

    The fix is a MERGE, never a re-time: when a cue ends on a dangling token, it absorbs the
    next cue and takes its end time. Timing stays exactly as aligned, so caption sync is
    untouched; only the grouping changes. Merging is capped so a cue can't grow past what

# THE ATTRIBUTION RIDES IN THE PICTURE (2026-08-09, owner's request).
#
# The music is CC BY 4.0 and the licence requires attribution wherever the work is
# distributed. The sources are what make the film's claims checkable. Both were being pasted
# into a LinkedIn first comment by hand every run, which put them on exactly one of the
# surfaces the video reaches: a file on TikTok, embedded on the site, or forwarded to anyone
# carried neither. A judge raised the missing credit as a hard blocker and was right.
#
# So the credits are DERIVED HERE, from the same files the rest of the run is checked
# against, and rendered by lib/EndCredits.tsx. Nothing is typed per run, so the card cannot
# drift from the record, and scripts/credits_check.py fails the run if it ever does.
# THE CREDITS DWELL IS A FLOOR, NOT A BUDGET (owner rule, 2026-08-12):
# "for the final scene that flashes the credits and sources and whatnot, leave that on screen
# for 10 seconds so ppl can actually read that stuff."
#
# It had drifted to 4.6s, and I am the one who cut it there, to claw back runtime after a
# slower VO take pushed the film past its ceiling. That was the wrong place to take the time
# from: the card carries the source list and the CC BY 4.0 music attribution, and attribution
# nobody can read is not attribution. Four and a half seconds is a flash, not a credit.
#
# This number may go UP for a longer card. It may not go down. scripts/credits_check.py
# enforces the floor against the DELIVERED BYTES, so editing this constant alone cannot
# defeat it, and neither can a run that decides it needs the seconds back.

# then the mark holds alone and fades last, so the film signs off on the logo. At a flat 10s
# card that left about 7.8s of legible source list, which is not what was asked for. The tail
# is added ON TOP of the floor so the readable window is the full ten seconds.
