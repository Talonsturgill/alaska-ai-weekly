# the denial, the fusion), S11 L22-24 (the date, the wall, the button).
# 2026-08-07 "The Boat, Not The Brain": TWELVE scenes (S1..S12 in video-engine/src/Ep0807.tsx)

    ADDED 2026-08-02 after a panel judge caught both failure modes in one film. Forced
    alignment chunks cues by width, which is correct for timing and blind to sense, so it
    produced "70 ash layers out of 8" / "tubes, a record they call virtually" (a number torn
    off its unit) and "It's confident about Katmai, Fisher" / "Caldera and Emmons Lake,
    because" (a two-word proper noun split across cards). Both read as errors to a viewer,
    because the eye finishes the line before the next one arrives.

    The fix is a MERGE, never a re-time: when a cue ends on a dangling token, it absorbs the
    next cue and takes its end time. Timing stays exactly as aligned, so caption sync is
    untouched; only the grouping changes. Merging is capped so a cue can't grow past what
    fits on two lines at phone size.
