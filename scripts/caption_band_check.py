"""Static gate: nothing informational may be authored into the open-caption band.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-06). Round 1's panel put "typography and captions" in the
weakest column for two of three judges, and the specific complaint was plated
annotations bisected by, buried under, or pushed below the open-caption card. The fix
that round was a HARD CLAMP inside the Plate component: a plate can never enter the
band, whatever a call site asks for.

The clamp was right and it was not enough, because it is SILENT. In S10 a call site
asked for y=1520 — visually sensible, below the caption card — and the clamp correctly
hauled it back up to ~1251, which is precisely where a different plate was already
sitting. Two plates rendered into the same pixels. The clamp turned one defect into
another one, and nothing anywhere said so: the source read fine, the types checked, the
render succeeded. It took reading the geometry by hand to find.

Two lessons, and this file is both of them.

  1. A clamp that silently overrides an author is a lie the source tells about itself.
     If the y in the code is not the y on screen, that must be an ERROR at build time,
     not a quiet correction at render time.
  2. The clamp only protects <Plate>. Raw <rect> and <text> go straight to the SVG, and
     three of them were sitting in the band: S1's SAME PIPE label at y=1424, S5's vendor
     card at 1300..1354, S10's calendar at 1330..1458. The component-level guard could
     never have seen any of them.

So this checks the SOURCE, where the mistake is actually made. Elements that genuinely
belong in the band — room floors, background fills, the caption card itself — declare it
with a `data-band="ok"` attribute (or a `caption-band-ok` comment on the same line or the
line above, where an attribute will not fit). That is a rule an author can satisfy on
purpose and cannot satisfy by accident. The attribute form is preferred because it rides
on the element itself: a refactor that moves the rect carries the exemption with it,
where a comment on a neighbouring line silently stops applying.

Exit 0 clean, exit 1 with findings. Wire it BEFORE the render, never after: this is a
gate on the source, and its whole value is refusing to spend seven minutes of render on
a frame that was already wrong.
