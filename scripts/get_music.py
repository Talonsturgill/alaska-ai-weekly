"""Fetch + prepare the Dispatch music bed, and emit the credit for the Gmail draft.

PRIMARY (every run): the routine RESEARCHES a fresh royalty-free track that fits THIS story, then
passes it here to download + validate + credit:
  python scripts/get_music.py --url <direct audio url> --title "T" --composer "C" \
      --license "CC BY 4.0" --source "pixabay.com" --out out/dispatch/music_bed.wav

BACKUP (only if the live search fails): pick a verified track from config/music_sources.yaml:
  python scripts/get_music.py --pool --mood ambient --out out/dispatch/music_bed.wav

It downloads, converts to 44.1k stereo WAV, VALIDATES it is real audio (>=20s, not a 404/HTML page),
and writes the credit to music_credit.json (and prints `CREDIT: ...`). The WAV path is the LAST
stdout line. Exit !=0 on any failure so the caller can fall back to the engine's synth bed.
Then set DISPATCH_MUSIC=<the wav> so audio_v3.py uses it.

# down, or intense or kinds of like doomy ... seems like the variety engines needs to swing a
# bit more in a different way or weight a diff style more then u are").
#
# The tonal chain was severed at the join and nobody could see it. Phase 2 writes
# out/dispatch/angle.json with a COMMITTED VALENCE -- the 08-13 run's says "Curious, and
# genuinely hopeful ... Not caution, because no Alaska outage is in the record" -- and this
# picker never read that file. It took a --mood string typed by hand and did random.choice over
# whatever matched. "ambient" is the easiest word to type and the pool's ambient entries are
# cold, vast, glacial and reflective, so a genuinely hopeful story got scored like a requiem,
# every time, and the palette followed the music into the same grey.
#
# Two rules now. First, the bed must not CONTRADICT the valence the writers room already
# committed to in prose. Second, the last few runs are a fact about tone: if the recent stack is
# all cold, this run has to swing, because "swing a bit more" is a property of the SEQUENCE and
# no single run can see it from inside itself.
