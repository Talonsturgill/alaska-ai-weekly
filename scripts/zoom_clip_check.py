"""Refuse anything the scene's own composed camera scale pushes off the side of the frame.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-09, found by looking at the contact sheet, not by any gate).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`text_fit_check.py` asks whether a string fits the plate drawn behind it. That is the right
question and it is not this one. A plate can fit its own box perfectly and still leave the
frame, because every scene in this engine composes a camera scale about x=540:

    x_rendered = 540 + (x_authored - 540) * SCALE

At SCALE 1.24 an element authored at x=760 with a 555px box renders from 469 to 1157, so 93
pixels of it are outside a 1080-wide frame. On the 2026-08-09 first cut that clipped five
elements, and the worst of them was the film's central quotation: NSF's own sentence lost a
word off each end and read on screen as "FORCEMENT-LEARNING CONTROLLERS ... GRATED WITH MICR".

Nothing caught it. text_fit_check passed, because each string fit its plate. caption_band_check
passed, because it models the VERTICAL crop and this is a horizontal one. plate_overlap_check
passed, because the boxes did not intersect each other. The defect only exists in the
relationship between an authored x and a scale declared somewhere else in the file, which is
exactly the "derive geometry, never hand-tune it" class from DISPATCH_STANDARD section 4.

WHAT THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE STILL COULD NOT SEE (found the same day, by a judge, in the
SECOND cut, which is the part worth writing down).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first version modelled SCALE as `max(CONTENT_ZOOM, zoom={...})` over the whole file and only
measured `<Plate>` and `<BrassPlate>`. Both halves of that were wrong, and each one shipped a
clipped element into a graded cut:

  1. Stage composes TWO factors, not one:  scale = (1 + push) * zoom.  `push` is the dolly, it
     ramps across the shot, and it is a real multiplier. Shot 6 declares zoom 1.02 and looks
     safe; its push reaches 0.10, so its true worst case is 1.122. The three money cards were
     authored 300 wide at x=196 and x=884 and lost 7px off ALASKA's left and WYOMING's right.
  2. A file-wide MAXIMUM is the wrong statistic even when it is conservative, because it is
     conservative in the wrong direction for every OTHER scene: it would fail plates that are
     fine and, worse, it invites the next person to loosen it. Scale is a per-scene fact, so it
     is now computed per scene.
  3. Most of what leaves the frame is not a Plate. `PUMPS / TIMING / POWER` is a bare <text>
     inside a translated <g>, and at shot 9's true scale of 1.144 its left edge rendered at
     x=3. So this checker now walks the translate stack and measures plain mono <text> too.

WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, stated so a pass is never mistaken for coverage: any element whose
position comes from a template literal, a variable, or a prop (the checker prints these as
"not measured" rather than assuming them safe), and any non-text geometry, which means a wide
<rect> or <path> can still bleed off the edge. Several do so deliberately, which is why raw
shapes are not graded here.
