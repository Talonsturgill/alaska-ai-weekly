"""Check the DERIVED square cut is safe, instead of convening a panel on it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-04, owner's process call).

The run had been grading BOTH deliverables with the full 3-judge panel every round.
That is double the review surface for one film, and it actively hurt: judges spent
findings on the 9:16 padding and on square-crop collisions in the same cards, the two
sets of notes competed for the same fix budget, and the composition axis was being
marked down twice for what is one authoring decision. The owner's instruction: make ONE
version right, then reformat and make a couple of tweaks, and stop checking both every
single time.

So the panel grades the MASTER (1080x1920), which is the native canvas and the cut that
goes to the other social platforms. The LinkedIn square is DERIVED from it by
crop=1080:1080:0:420, and its correctness is a mechanical question, not a taste one:
does the crop slice anything that matters?

That is what this measures. For each sampled frame it looks at the two crop boundary
rows and asks whether structured content (plate edges, type, ink outlines) crosses them.
Background gradient crossing a crop line is fine and expected. A headline plate, a
caption band or a character's head crossing one is not, because in the square that
becomes a thing cut in half at the frame edge.

HONEST LIMITS, stated so a pass is not over-read:
  - It detects STRUCTURE crossing the boundary, not meaning. A decorative foreground
    bough crossing the bottom line will flag, and that is a false positive a human
    dismisses in one look at the named timecode.
  - It says nothing about whether the square composition is well-staged, only that it
    does not cut through something built.
  - It samples; it does not check every frame.

    """Fraction of the row at y whose vertical neighbourhood carries a real edge.

    IT WAS MEASURING FILM GRAIN (fixed 2026-08-08). Two panel judges independently took
    this gate apart in the same round. The grade's grain measures std 5.65 and p2p 60
    eight-bit levels on a FLAT WALL, and this function took the MAX vertical difference per
    column over an eight-row band across three channels, so a threshold of 26 was cleared on
    97.5% of columns of bare plaster. One judge pulled the top rows at the three
    highest-scoring timecodes (0.971, 0.934, 0.890) and found bare wall or an uncut
    decorative card at all three.

    So the reported 24-of-64 crossings were noise, and the improvement from 24 to 22 that
    this run cited as evidence of a fix was meaningless in both directions. Worse, as the
    judge put it: a 34% false-positive rate guarantees the next real head-or-plate clip gets
    waved through. Same family as the six gates this run found reporting on the wrong
    subject, arriving by a third route - the measure drifted away from what it was meant to
    detect while the number kept looking authoritative.

    I TRIED TWICE TO FIX THE METRIC AND BOTH ATTEMPTS FAILED, so the honest outcome is a
    documented limitation rather than a third guess.

    Attempt one took the MEDIAN of the row-differences across the band. It erased grain
    beautifully and erased every real edge with it, because a plate boundary appears in
    exactly ONE of the band's row-differences and the median of one hit and seven misses is
    a miss. Against a synthesised 240px plate edge it returned 0.000, identical to bare
    wall. The headline number - 22 crossings down to 0 - looked exactly like success, and
    only a regression test with a known-bad frame caught it.

    Attempt two averaged along x to exploit coherence, on the theory that grain is spatially
    uncorrelated while a plate edge spans hundreds of columns. That is sound, and it did not
    help, because the second judge measured the offending row more precisely than the first:
    it is not grain, it is a REAL full-width wall-tile seam, luminance 225 falling to 183.
    Genuine structure that happens to be background.

    So the metric cannot be rescued at this row. A one-row horizontal seam spanning the
    frame and a plate's bottom border spanning the frame are the same measurement, and no
    threshold separates them, because the difference is not in the pixels - it is in whether
    the element was AUTHORED. The build-time invariant knows that and this does not:
    Ep0808's SAFE_TOP composes caption_band_check's SAFE_Y_MIN with the content zoom and
    THROWS on an authored element crossing the line. That check is the authoritative one.

    This file is therefore demoted to what it can honestly do: point a human at timecodes
    where SOMETHING crosses a crop line, for a look. Its count is not evidence of a defect
    and must never again be quoted as evidence of a fix, which is exactly what this run did
    when it reported 24 crossings falling to 22 as if that meant anything.
