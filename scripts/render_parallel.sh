# PARALLEL RENDER — split the frame range across SEPARATE PROCESSES, then concat.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-04 on the 4-core / 15GB routine box, 240 frames of Dispatch0803:
#     one process, --concurrency=2 ....... 149s
#     one process, --concurrency=4 ....... 155s   (NO GAIN)
#     four processes, 60 frames each ......  56s   (2.7x FASTER)
#
# AND THEN, on the full 2513-frame film, 4 equal chunks measured:
#     chunk 0 (S1-S3, characters + packet) .. ~14 min
#     chunks 1, 2, 3 ........................ ~4 min each, then idle
# i.e. ~26 min of work spread over 4 slots finished in 14 min of wall clock, because equal
# FRAME counts are not equal WORK. Hence the queue below: 12 chunks through 4 slots.
#
# So Remotion's in-process concurrency does not scale here: the tabs contend inside
# one Chrome and adding more just adds contention. Separate PROCESSES each get their
# own browser and do scale. That is why raising --concurrency looked like the obvious
# lever and did nothing, and it is why the owner remembered splitting the render.
#
# On the full 2513-frame film: ~30 minutes single-process, 14 with 4 equal chunks, and
# the queue below is what closes the rest of the gap toward the ~7 the work actually costs.
#
# Concat is STREAM COPY (-c copy), so the output is bit-identical to a single-process
# render; no re-encode, no generation loss. Chunk boundaries are exact frame ranges so
# no frame is rendered twice or skipped, and the script ASSERTS the final frame count
# against the expected total before it will hand back a file.
#
# Usage: scripts/render_parallel.sh <Comp> <out.mp4> [total_frames] [chunks]

# A SOURCE EDIT DURING A RENDER PRODUCES A MIXED FILM, AND NOTHING DOWNSTREAM CAN SEE IT

# started yet and missed by the ones already running, and the concatenated result is part
# old film and part new with no seam anyone can detect.
#
# The freshness check downstream cannot catch this: it compares the finished mp4's mtime
# against the newest source, and a mixed render is NEWER than every source. It looks fresh
# precisely because it is.
#
# So the fingerprint is taken before the first chunk and checked after the last one. It is
# a warning rather than a hard failure because a comment-only edit changes the hash without
# changing a pixel - which is exactly what happened the day this was written, when a render
# was killed on an mtime alone and the edit turned out to be a comment.
