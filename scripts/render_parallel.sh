# PARALLEL RENDER — split the frame range across SEPARATE PROCESSES, then concat.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-04 on the 4-core / 15GB routine box, 240 frames of Dispatch0803:
#     one process, --concurrency=2 ....... 149s
#     one process, --concurrency=4 ....... 155s   (NO GAIN)
#     four processes, 60 frames each ......  56s   (2.7x FASTER)
#
# AND THEN, on the full 2513-frame film, 4 equal chunks measured:
#     chunk 0 (S1-S3, characters + packet) .. ~14 min
#     chunks 1, 2, 3 ........................ ~4 min each, then idle
# i.e. ~26 min of work spread over 4 slots finished in 14 min of wall clock, because equal
# FRAME counts are not equal WORK. Hence the queue below: 12 chunks through 4 slots.
#
# So Remotion's in-process concurrency does not scale here: the tabs contend inside
# one Chrome and adding more just adds contention. Separate PROCESSES each get their
# own browser and do scale. That is why raising --concurrency looked like the obvious
# lever and did nothing, and it is why the owner remembered splitting the render.
#
# On the full 2513-frame film: ~30 minutes single-process, 14 with 4 equal chunks, and
# the queue below is what closes the rest of the gap toward the ~7 the work actually costs.
#
# Concat is STREAM COPY (-c copy), so the output is bit-identical to a single-process
# render; no re-encode, no generation loss. Chunk boundaries are exact frame ranges so
# no frame is rendered twice or skipped, and the script ASSERTS the final frame count
# against the expected total before it will hand back a file.
#
# Usage: scripts/render_parallel.sh <Comp> <out.mp4> [total_frames] [chunks]

# NO DEFAULT COMPOSITION (2026-08-08). This read `${1:-Dispatch0803}`, so invoking the

# 2.5 hours: the render succeeded, printed OK, produced a valid 3835-frame file with a
# plausible size, and every downstream step would have graded the wrong movie.
#
# A default target is only ever right for the run it was written in. Nothing about a
# per-run composition id belongs in a fallback, because the failure mode is not an error
# but a confident success on the wrong subject. Same family as the three gates this run
# that reported clean while reading a shipped July episode.

# ONE RENDER AT A TIME (2026-08-08). Two instances were started minutes apart because the
# first launch LOOKED like it had failed - the command that started it errored on an
# unrelated `head` of its log, so it read as dead, while nohup had in fact started it and
# the script's own `cd` had already corrected its working directory.
#
# They then fought over CPU and over identically-named chunk files, and the run reported
# "a chunk failed" while every chunk log showed 320/320 encoded. That is an expensive way
# to lose half an hour: the failure message pointed at rendering, and the cause was that
# there were two of everything.
#
# A render is exclusive by nature, so say so rather than trusting the caller to have
# checked. flock releases automatically if the holder is killed, so a crashed run does not
# leave a lock nobody can clear.

# MORE CHUNKS THAN SLOTS, ON PURPOSE (2026-08-04). The first version cut the film into
# exactly one chunk per slot, which is only optimal when every frame costs the same. It
# does not: on the 2026-08-03 film, chunk 0 held S1 to S3, which carry the characters and
# the award packet, and it took about 14 minutes while chunks 1, 2 and 3 finished in about
# 4 and then sat idle. Wall clock was 14 minutes for roughly 26 minutes of work across 4
# slots, so three quarters of the machine was doing nothing for ten minutes.
#
# Smaller chunks fed through a work queue fix that without needing to predict which shots
# are expensive: when a slot frees, it takes the next chunk. The cost is one extra Chrome
# start per chunk (~10-15s), which is why this is 12 and not 60.

# hit chunk 0 on one render and chunk 3 on the next, so it is not a property of any shot.

# Left alone this stalls the WHOLE render behind one dead slot, and a run that is waiting
# on a process that will never finish looks exactly like a run that is making progress.
