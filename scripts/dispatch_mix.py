"""Mix the Dispatch master audio: VO (dominant) + ducked music bed + SFX events,
with a real pre-button silence dip, normalized to -14 LUFS / TP <= -1.0 dBTP.

2026-07-21 SOUND-DESIGN OVERHAUL (owner: "ours is boring and reusing the same
sfx"). Every event is now PERFORMED, not placed:
  - VARIANT TAKES: sfx_bank.resolve(kind, episode_seed=DATE) shuffle-bags the
    6-take bank so no two plays of a kind reuse a take;
  - CLASS GAIN TIERS instead of flat volume=0.5 — hero hits peak ~-11 dBFS,
    standard accents ~-15, textures/sweeteners ~-19 (VO peaks -12..-6 stays
    the anchor);
  - DETERMINISTIC JITTER from crc32(DATE:idx): pitch (cents by family: UI ~40,
    impacts ~75, paper ~150, metal ~30 — metal variety lives in the modal
    variants), volume +/-1.5 dB, timing +/-15 ms (humanizes the grid);
  - PAN FROM THE PICTURE: each event carries the prop's storyboard x as a pan
    in [-1,1], scaled to max +/-0.35; hero payoff hits stay centered
    (mono-compatible for phone speakers);
  - FREQUENCY SLOTTING: the bed and all SUSTAINED sfx (whoosh/riser/paper/
    chain/creak) get a wide -2.5 dB dip at 3 kHz + a 100 Hz high-pass so they
    never fight VO intelligibility (2-5 kHz); short transients keep their
    energy — they read between syllables;
  - SCHEDULING ASSERT: no two consecutive events from the same sound FAMILY
    (spectral sameness is what reads "repetitive", not the count).

# THE MIX HAS AN ARC NOW (2026-07-31, round 6 panel note: "the mix is flat -- LRA 3.10").
#
# Two separate things were making it flat, and only one of them was the bed.
#
# 1. The bed sat at a constant 0.30 for the whole 91 seconds. A documentary bed that never
#    moves is wallpaper: it tells the ear that nothing in the argument is more important
#    than anything else, which is exactly the opposite of what this script does. The arc
#    below is written against the SCRIPT, not against a clock -- it thins hard under the
#    two concession lines (43.4s "so he's right that there's a hole" and 46.1s "Alaska has
#    a patchwork, not a process"), because a concession delivered over a full bed sounds
#    like a rhetorical move rather than an honest one, and it swells into the closing
#    questions at 82.5s where the piece stops arguing and starts asking.
#
# 2. Single-pass dynamic loudnorm was undoing whatever arc existed anyway. In dynamic mode
#    loudnorm is a slow AGC: it walks the gain toward the target continuously, so a bed
#    that drops 6 dB gets quietly pushed back up over the next few seconds and the range
#    collapses. That is where an LRA of 3.10 comes from. main() now measures the premix and
#    applies a LINEAR (static-gain) correction, which hits the same -14 LUFS without
#    touching the dynamics.
#
# Multipliers are relative to the bed's base level, so the shape lives here and the level
# lives in one place in the graph.

    FLAT SUM OF GATED SEGMENTS, NOT NESTED ifs (rewritten 2026-08-05, and it was a real
    outage rather than a tidy-up). This function used to wrap one `if(lt(t,..),..,..)`
    around the previous result per breakpoint, so the nesting depth equalled the number of
    breakpoints. ffmpeg's expression evaluator gives up somewhere above roughly a hundred
    levels, and it does not fail with "too deep", it fails with a bare "Invalid argument"

    That threshold is a function of THE NARRATION, not of the code: the bed lifts into

    gaps, which is an ordinary 90-second read and exactly what this run produced, emits
    106 nested ifs and the entire mix dies. Any future run with a slightly breathier
    delivery would have hit it too.

    matter how many breakpoints there are. `gte(t,a)*lt(t,b)` is used rather than
