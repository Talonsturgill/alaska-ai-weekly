"""BEAT DELIVERY — did the BUILD draw the event the BOARD promised?

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-31, and it exists because the first attempt at this was aimed at the
wrong stage).

That run's film lost 55% of its weighted points across four axes (Hook 0.44, Motion 0.38,
Illustration 0.37, Composition 0.29) and all three judges described one cause: beats that are
stated on cards instead of drawn. The obvious inference was that the STORYBOARD was scheduling
type where it should schedule events, so a Gate 0 checker was written to refuse such a board.

Run against the actual board, it passed every beat. The board was not the problem. Every beat
named a physical event; the BUILD did not draw them:

  - board t=43.02: "the bare ground opens as a gap where there was never a gate".
    Judge 1, on the delivered frames: "no hole, gap or ground event is drawn".
  - board t=55.04, the film's declared reveal: a slot cut on screen with daylight through it.
    Judge 2: "that image only appears at 80.64 on a different beat".

So the failure is BOARD-TO-BUILD DRIFT, and no amount of storyboard discipline catches it,
because the board was already right. It has to be measured on the rendered frames.

WHAT THIS MEASURES
------------------
For each beat, sample the render across the beat's own window and compute how much of the
picture actually CHANGES, ignoring the caption band (burned captions swap constantly and would
mask a frozen frame -- which is exactly how these beats survived seventeen review rounds) and
ignoring the global grade. A beat whose board promises an event and whose frames barely move
is a beat the film asserts rather than shows.

It is deliberately a LOW bar. It does not judge whether the motion is good, eased, or
motivated; the panel does that. It answers one question no reviewer could reliably answer by
eye at contact-sheet scale: did anything happen here at all.
