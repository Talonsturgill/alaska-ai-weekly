"""DEAD-SPACE METER — turn "the frame feels empty" into a number you can act on.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-31, after two panel rounds).

"Mean low-information area is roughly 50 percent" was the single most repeated finding
across two rounds and three judges, and it survived a whole editing round in which I added
a far ridge, wheel ruts, a gravel scatter, a verge, a near berm and a ground falloff. All
of that was texture, and texture is not information. The reason the round failed on this
axis is that I was guessing at what "empty" meant and shipping fixes I could not measure,
so I could not tell the difference between a frame that got better and a frame that got
busier.

The measure: a pixel is LOW INFORMATION if its neighbourhood carries almost no structure
(local standard deviation under a threshold) AND it is not close to an edge. Gradients,
noise textures and subtle scatter all stay low-information, which is correct — a viewer
gets nothing from them. Ink outlines, type, and real objects raise local structure, which
is also correct. The score is the fraction of frame area that is low-information.

Use it as a RATCHET, not a target: measure, change one thing, measure again, keep the
change if the number moved. Reported per-shot so the worst shots are named rather than
averaged away.

WHY IT WAS REWRITTEN (2026-08-04, after the panel found 12 to 14 seconds of empty frames
inside the retention window and this script did not).

The meter was correct and unreachable. Three separate reasons, each enough on its own:

  1. It read PNGs from out/dispatch/frames, and the pipeline renders straight to mp4. That
     directory has never existed on a normal run, so every invocation died on "no frames"
     and the step was quietly skipped. A check with a precondition no run satisfies is not
     a check.
  2. It only PRINTED. `worst` was computed, named, and then the process exited 0. Nothing
     downstream could tell a clean film from a film with three empty shots.
  3. It measured the 1080x1920 master. The LinkedIn deliverable is the 1:1 SQUARE CUT, and
     the square throws away 840 rows. A subject parked at the top of the tall frame is
     centred and fine there and gone from the thing people actually see.

All three are the same shape as the no_exit hole closed earlier today: an artifact that
looked like a gate, read as authoritative, and could not fail. So this now samples the
SHIPPED VIDEO with ffmpeg, measures the cut that ships, and EXITS 1.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, stated plainly so nobody trusts it for more than it is worth. This
measures TEXTURE-FREE AREA, which is not the same thing as "no subject in the shot". On
the cut the panel faulted for empty frames, the shots the judges named scored 27 to 30
percent while three shots they did not name scored 39 to 45. Big flat colour fields are
this brand, and they read as empty to the meter whether or not something is happening in
front of them. So the ceilings below are a RATCHET against regression, deliberately set
just above the worst film measured rather than at a level that would have caught the
2026-08-03 defect, because a gate tuned to catch that one would fail three innocent shots
every run and would be turned off within a week. Judging whether a shot has a SUBJECT is
still the panel's job, and the storyboard's.
