"""Prove the evidence pack actually shows the film, before a judge grades it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-06, and it cost this run at least four judge-rounds).

A panel can only grade what it is shown. Every time the pack failed to show something, a
judge reported that thing as absent — correctly, about the evidence, and wrongly about the
film — and the run spent a round chasing a defect that did not exist:

  - c11 "14 DAYS, THEN DELETED" is on screen 44.43s..46.90s. The nearest filmstrip sampled
    42.64s and the contact sheet sampled 39.5s and 48.3s. Three judges reported Anchorage's
    counter-case as thin or missing. It was drawn, and invisible to the pack.
  - The S11 thesis wall rides a fade. Every strip and every contact frame ever taken of it
    landed at 50% or 78% opacity, so three judges across three rounds reported no orange
    brackets and no grey box on the film's closing argument.
  - Two strips were centred on the soft tail of a hard ease-out and measured 1.6%, which
    reads as "frozen" and means "sampled forty frames after the event".

Each of those cost a full render-and-regrade cycle. That is the most expensive way in this
pipeline to discover a sampling error.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  1. every shot has at least one filmstrip
  2. every storyboard beat has a sample (strip centre or contact frame) within --beat-window
  3. no strip is centred where the picture is nearly static, which almost always means the
     anchor is on an ease-out tail rather than on the move

It reads out/evidence/motion.json and the contact frame times from the jpg filenames, so it
grades the pack that exists rather than the pack that was intended.
