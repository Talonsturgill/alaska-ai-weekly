"""Build the panel evidence pack, with sample times DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED TAKE.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-03). The evidence pack for this run's first panel was cut at
STORYBOARD times while the shipped take's line starts differ by up to ~12s. The result
was that two of the three motion filmstrips sampled windows in which nothing was
happening: the punch fires at 38.1s and the strip was cut at 40.0, the drain runs
74.1 to 76.5 and the strip was cut at 74.0 and caught only its first 0.27s. All three
judges then reported, correctly and independently, that the film's signature events
"do not happen on screen", and the panel median came in at 6.43 against a 7.5 bar on
evidence that misrepresented the film.

That is the same class of bug as the 2026-07-15 stale-frame incident: an artifact read
BY PATH that looked plausible and was wrong. The fix is the same shape, a code guard
rather than a doctrine note. Filmstrip centres are now computed from vo_lines.json plus
a named offset INTO the line, so re-synthesising the voice moves the evidence with the
picture exactly as it moves the scenes.

Usage: python3 scripts/build_evidence.py [--video out/dispatch/dispatch_square.mp4]
