"""Run every mechanical gate BEFORE a panel is ever convened. Exit nonzero if any fail.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-05, owner: "I'm frustrated at ur pre-panel performance").

The mechanical gates in this repo are good and they were being run inconsistently, after
the fact, one at a time, by a run that remembered to. So cuts reached the panel carrying
defects that a script could have named in four seconds: a string wider than its plate, a
stale deliverable, an evidence pack describing a file that no longer existed. Three judges
then spent twenty minutes each rediscovering them, and a fix round went on something
arithmetic.

A checklist in a document is a suggestion. This is the checklist as a program. The routine
runs it before convening a panel, and a failure here means the panel does not get convened,
because a judge's attention is the most expensive thing in the loop and it should never be
spent on something a regex can find.

It deliberately does NOT judge quality. Everything here is a fact check: does the string
fit, do the bytes match, is the report measured rather than typed. Taste is the panel's
job and this file has no opinion about it.
