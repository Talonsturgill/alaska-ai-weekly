"""VO CLAIMS CHECK — does the NARRATION obey the fact-check-safe set?

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-08).

On this run the caption scorer found a hard fail in the LinkedIn post: the copy said the
X-ray machines went to "five rural clinics that didn't have one". That is an inference.
The claim record (c4) supports only "portable X-ray machines for five rural clinics", and
claims.json explicitly bans any imaging-absence claim, because the only source for it is a
single first-person essay three years old. It was also the one invented detail attached to
an Alaska Native nonprofit, which is where the claim set is strictest.

The same sentence was in the NARRATION, and by the time the scorer found it the voice had
already been synthesized. It cost two rounds of surgical line patching to remove.

The gap is structural, not a lapse. The caption is gated by a scorer that reads claims.json.
The VO script is gated by Gate 0E, which asks whether a STRANGER CAN FOLLOW IT, and by the
soundcheck, which asks whether the ASR heard the right words. Nothing between the writers
room and the TTS ever compares the script to the EVIDENCE. So a false line can pass every
gate the pipeline has and reach synthesis.

This closes that. It is deliberately mechanical and deliberately narrow: it cannot judge
whether a sentence is true, so it checks the two things a machine CAN check.

  1. OBLIGATIONS. Every claims.json claim carries a `requires` block, written by the
     fact-checker, listing what the film must do to use it honestly. Where an obligation
     names a word the line must contain (STUDY, IN THIS ROUND, YEAR ONE, JUNE 2026...), a
     line citing that claim must contain it. Where an obligation BANS a form, the line must
     not contain it.
  2. UNSOURCED QUANTIFICATION. A line that states a number, a proportion or a superlative
     and cites NO claim id is an assertion the record has not been asked about. That is
     exactly the shape of the line that got through.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/vo_claims_check.py            # exit 1 on any violation
    python3 scripts/vo_claims_check.py --list     # print what it derived, exit 0
    python3 scripts/vo_claims_check.py --before-synth  # provisional density, no old timings

It reads the SCRIPT, so it runs BEFORE a second of TTS is spent, which is the whole point.
