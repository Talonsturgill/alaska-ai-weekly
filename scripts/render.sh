# stills — look, fix, re-render 3-5x at low cost. Only the FINAL gate and the
# judge panel see a full-res render. Draft stills are half-res; critics grading
# COMPOSITION/story can use them, but legibility checks (caption px heights)
# must run on a final-res render.

# every explicit OUT argument was silently written to video-engine/out/... instead of the
# repo-root out/... the caller expected, so a mux+gate cycle kept re-testing a stale file
# and made real engine fixes look like no-ops. Only the DEFAULT out paths below (relative

# THE COMPOSITION LOCK (added 2026-07-31, after rendering the wrong film).
#
# Root.tsx keeps every past episode registered, and the generic id "Dispatch" is still
# wired to a PREVIOUS run's component. Rendering "Dispatch" therefore succeeds, exits 0,
# writes an mp4 of the right length, and produces the wrong film. It did: this run rendered
# 93.3 seconds of the July 26 episode, whose scenes run out around 60 seconds, so the last
# third came out as blank grey with this run's captions burned over it. Nothing in the
# pipeline objected. Every hash matched, the mux verified, the encodes passed their ffprobe
# assertions, and the freshness check was satisfied, because all of those check that the
# deliverable is CURRENT and none of them check that it is the right MOVIE.
#
# So the run's composition id is now recorded in out/dispatch/.run_stamp.json and this
# wrapper refuses to render anything else. A stale id from an old command line, an old doc,
# or a habit stops here instead of at the panel.
