"""FORMAT GATE SELF-TEST — prove the gates enforce the runtime format they claim to.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-05, the 90s -> 120s upgrade). A format change edits numbers in
three config files and rules in two gate scripts, and the failure mode is silent in BOTH
directions:

  - a rule that does not actually bind lets a padded two-minute film pass, and the whole
    point of the upgrade was that the extra thirty seconds must be earned;
  - a rule that binds too hard retroactively fails a legal SHORTER board, which breaks
    the archive and any re-run.

Neither shows up by running the gates on the one board you happen to have. So this
builds three boards from a real shipped one and asserts the gates react correctly:

  CONFORMING  a 120s board that satisfies every two-minute rule            -> must PASS
  PADDED      the 86s story with filler beats out to 120s and nothing else -> must FAIL,
              and must fail with the SPECIFIC two-minute rules, not by accident
  LEGACY      the shipped 86s board, untouched                             -> must PASS

Divergence/ledger failures are ignored throughout: a synthetic board reuses a real
board's composition on purpose, and the ledger is right to say so. This test is about the
RUNTIME rules only.

Usage: python3 scripts/format_gate_selftest.py
Exit 0 if every assertion holds.

    would let this test pass while proving nothing.

    Real padding is the 90-second cut with thirty seconds of more-of-the-same on the end.
    The story lands where it always landed and the film keeps going. So: keep every
    original time, append legal filler beats out to the target, and add nothing else.
