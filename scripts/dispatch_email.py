"""Build the Gmail draft payload for a finished Alaska.Ai video Dispatch (story-agnostic).

Media is NEVER base64'd through the model. The routine uploads the cuts (and ideally the poster)
with scripts/upload_video.py and passes their direct-download URLs here. This prints the draft
payload JSON {subject,to,html_body} on the LAST stdout line for the orchestrator to hand to the
Gmail create_draft connector (use --poster-url, not --poster, to keep that payload small).

Usage:
  python scripts/dispatch_email.py \
    --post out/dispatch/post.txt \
    --video-url-vertical "<9:16 url>" --video-url-square "<1:1 square url>" \
    --poster-url "<poster url>" \
    --voice "Kokoro af_heart" --music '"Title" Composer (source) - CC BY 4.0' \
    --sources out/dispatch/sources.json --score "9.2/10" \
    --note "On-screen numbers are illustrative unless drawn from a live feed." \

    """Refuse to build the draft unless every download link actually resolves to media.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-12, owner directive, verbatim: "I do not go into github to find
    videos. You are explicitly instructed to drop the download links in my email ... fix
    whatever allowed u to take the easy way out and fail again").

    That run's upload step failed loudly and correctly: upload_video.py exited 3 because
    git config user.email was unset, so media_email() refused to author a media commit as
    Anthropic. The defect was NOT the refusal. The defect was what happened next — the run
    hand-wrote a Gmail draft with no video links at all and a caveat line explaining their
    absence, and called that delivered. The pipeline had no opinion, because --video-url-*
    was only ever checked for being a non-empty string. A caveat is not a deliverable. The
    video IS the deliverable, and a draft without a working link to it has not delivered it.

    So the link is now load-bearing the same way the sources block is: no working link, no
    draft. The check is upload_video.verify()'s, minus the local-file comparison it cannot
    do from a URL alone:
      (1) the URL path ends in a media extension, so it downloads as a playable file rather
          than an extensionless octet-stream blob (the 2026-07-21 dead-link bug), and
      (2) the final response is 200, and
      (3) it is not served as text/html, which is what a 404 page or a login wall looks like
          to a naive status check, and
      (4) Content-Length, when present, is over 100 KB — a real cut is tens of megabytes and
          anything smaller is an error document with a generous status code.

    There is deliberately no bypass flag. The whole failure mode was a run granting itself
    permission to ship less than the deliverable; a gate with an escape hatch is a suggestion.
    A genuinely link-less run is a FAILED run: fix the upload and re-run, do not email a
    caveat. --temporary is not a bypass either; it only relaxes nothing and still requires
    the temporary host to be answering right now.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-06, and it is the root cause of four separate owner catches
    in one afternoon: no hashtags, a colon, a semicolon, and a sentence starting "But").

    Every one of those rules was ALREADY written and ALREADY a hard fail in
    caption_check.py. The linter was not weak, it was not consulted. The run wrote two
    files -- out/dispatch/caption.txt and out/dispatch/post.txt -- linted the first
    (which had all five hashtags and passed clean, caption_report.json says PASS) and
    emailed the second. Nothing in the pipeline knew those were supposed to be the same
    copy, so a green report sat next to a draft that violated four house rules.

    That is this repo's most expensive recurring shape: a gate that grades an artifact BY
    PATH while a different artifact ships. It has now cost a stale filmstrip anchor set, a
    stale deliverable at the ship gate, an evidence pack that photographed the wrong
    seconds, and this.

    The only fix that holds is to make the check inseparable from the delivery, so the
    linted bytes and the emailed bytes are the same bytes by construction. This function
    takes the string, not a path, precisely so no caller can point it somewhere else.

    THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO OVERRIDE FLAG. A --no-copy-check would be used at 3am by the
    same reasoning that produced the defect, and the whole value here is that the rule is
    not negotiable at delivery time. If a rule is wrong, change the rule in
    caption_check.py where the reasoning is written down and reviewable.
