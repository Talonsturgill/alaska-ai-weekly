 *
 *  The shipped LinkedIn cut is crop=1080:1080:0:420, so master rows above 420 do not
 *  exist for most of the audience. scripts/caption_band_check.py derives its SAFE_Y_MIN
 *  from the World push alone:
 *
 *      SAFE_Y_MIN = 960 - (960 - 420 - 14) / 1.062  =  464.7
 *
 *  ...but every scene's content also sits inside Stage's CONTENT ZOOM, a further 1.12
 *  about y=960, which the gate cannot see because it is applied in a different group.
 *  A plate authored at the gate's "safe" 465 actually renders at
 *  960 + (465-960)*1.12*1.045 = 381, i.e. 39px ABOVE the crop line, and the gate says
 *  clean. That is how S3's "CAPITAL CAPPED AT 20%" (authored top 500, gate-clean by
 *  35px) shipped with its top border cut off: measured at t=22.55s it rendered at 430,
 *  ~10px of margin, and the 2026-08-08 panel called it. Same class as S13's page, whose
 *  top border crosses the crop line at t=110.5s and is gone entirely by t=113s.
 *
 *  So this is the gate's own arithmetic with the zoom put back in. Same 420, same 14px
 *  drift allowance; a call site passes the largest push its Stage ever reaches. Anything
 *  informational must author its TOP edge at or below the returned y.

/** THE NEAR FIELD — the working edge of the desk the whole film is shot across.
 *
 *  TWO defects, one object. The 2026-08-08 panel measured "9 of the 14 sampled stills
 *  leave 25 to 35 percent of the 9:16 frame as empty desk", naming f013.7, f022.8,
 *  f050.2, f077.6, f095.9 and f114.1 — every one of them a shot whose bottom quarter is
 *  a flat birch gradient below the caption card. The same panel scored motion 5.5 because
 *  every shot HOLDS after its build. A near-field row of case folders answers both: it is
 *  real depth where there was fill, and each folder carries its own phase-staggered idle,
 *  so no frame of this film is ever a still photograph again.
 *
 *  IT HAS TO BE IN THE SQUARE, WHICH IS WHERE IT WAS NOT (2026-08-08 panel, both judges,
 *  independently). The shipped LinkedIn deliverable is crop=1080:1080:0:420, i.e. rows
 *  420..1500 of the 1920-tall master. This row began at FG_TOP = 1480 and ran to ~1710, so
 *  the square contained essentially ZERO pixels of it and the empty-desk finding that
 *  motivated the whole layer was unfixed in the cut most of the audience sees. The band now
 *  starts at 1384 and its lowest folder tops out at 1436, so every folder is inside the
 *  square with 60 to 110 rows showing.
 *
 *  It is drawn OUTSIDE the content zoom, so authored y IS screen y (no 1.12x surprise).
 *  Every scene's World push in this episode is >= 0 (S3 and S10 fall from +0.06 to 0, never
 *  negative), so the band can only ever be pushed DOWN, never up: the worst case is S10's
 *  0.07 at its first frame, which puts the top edge at 960 + (1384-960)*1.07 = 1414.
 *
 *  It carries NO information: no text, no glyph, no number. It is furniture, and it is
 *  BEHIND the caption card — the captions are a separate DOM layer composited after every
 *  scene, so nothing here can ever sit on top of a caption. */

 *  finished and another charged the S6 grid as "flat grey fills with three rules and a
 *  hairline shadow". They are different cards and both were right: S9 drew its own dark
 *  cards with a FormGradient, a RimLight and a ContactShadow, while this component — which
 *  is what the S6 grid uses, and the S6 grid is the dominant surface of the film's longest
 *  shot — had a two-stop linear fill and a 2.5px white nick. An unlit card is DIMMER, not
 *  UNFINISHED, so it now runs the same three devices off a darker base.
 *
 *  SIZE AND COPY ARE BOTH CALLER-SET. The described awards are near-field and carry their
 *  claim's whole `on_screen` string, so the box has to be able to grow and the face has to
 *  take more than a title and an amount. `lines` is line-broken copy, never abridged copy.
 *
 *  AND THE COPY IS ONE CONTIGUOUS ARRAY, with the type sizes in a SEPARATE one. The first
 *  cut of this interleaved them as [{t, size}, {t, size}, ...], which reads fine and is
 *  invisible to scripts/claims_contract_check.py: that gate normalises the source to bare
 *  content, so the interleaved `size: 20` landed between two halves of an organisation's
 *  name and c5's approved string stopped matching a card that was drawing it correctly. A

/** THE CAP TABLE — c17, drawn at last, and it is the fact the record asked for.
 *
 *  TWO findings, one object.
 *
 *  1. c17's own note in out/dispatch/claims.json reads: "This substantiates Rep. Mina's June
 *     complaint without needing to take her word for it." Three of its four figures had never
 *     been on screen anywhere in the film — provider payments at 15 percent, administrative at
 *     10, and a Technology Innovation Catalyst Fund at 10 percent capped at $20M. Only the 20
 *     percent capital cap shipped, in S3. A fact-checked figure sitting unused while the shot
 *     it was written for holds on a name plate is the note being declined, which is the exact
 *     failure scripts/claims_contract_check.py exists to stop.
 *
 *  2. scripts/content_sag_check.py measured 24.50s..30.00s as a 5.5-second window where the
 *     story region does not change — 5.5 seconds of narration introducing her over a frame
 *     holding one plate. That is longer than the gate's own 5-second rule.
 *
 *  So the record she read arrives while she is being introduced, and the quote lands on top of
 *  it. The move is S3's, deliberately: a collar that descends and clamps is what a cap looks
 *  like in this film, and here it happens four times with four real numbers instead of once.
 *  The strings are c17's, verbatim from its `text`; nothing is abbreviated into a figure the
 *  record does not carry, and nothing here is attributed to the federal statute (that is c12b,
 *  a different claim and a different register — see c12's `requires`).
 *
 *  GEOMETRY. The board is 130..950 x 876..1170 in scene space. Above it the REP. GENEVIEVE MINA
 *  plate bottoms at 859 (17px clear); below it the AI slug's body tops at 1182 (12px clear);
 *  and it is wholly retired by local 230, four frames before the quote card arrives at 906..1056
 *  on 226 — they never share a frame, which is why this is not the stacked-card mistake of
 *  2026-08-06. */

  // other. They used to all be on the board by local 64 and the shot then held for seven
  // seconds. Spread onto the words, so the board is still filling while she reads it out.
  //
  // ...WHICH WAS STILL NOT AN EVENT (2026-08-08, content_sag_check). Spreading the reveals
  // did not fix the window: 36.00..42.00s measured a 6.00s continuous sag with a 7.1% floor,
  // the longest dead stretch in the film. The reason is that an AllowanceBoard row IS only a
  // 22px bullet and a word — about 1.3% of the story region — so five of them arriving over
  // six seconds repaints almost nothing, whatever the timing. The panel's charge and the
  // gate's number are the same fact: the picture was one dark panel filling in very slowly.
  //
  // So the list is READ, physically. A machined straightedge lies across the board and
  // descends it, and everything below the rule is still in shadow. Its schedule is derived
  // from the ROWS, not picked: at the frame row i lands, the rule is exactly at that row's
  // lower edge, so the words arrive as the light reaches them. That is a boundary sweeping
  // 890px of board at 75px a second, which is a real event in every one-second window the
  // gate samples, and it is also just what reading a list down a page looks like.
  //
  // AND THE WORDS COME OUT FROM UNDER THE RULE, which is not a flourish — it is the only
  // way this staging is legible. The first render of it kept the old independent reveal
  // ramps, and at t=38.0s the straightedge was lying across WEARABLES while WEARABLES was
  // still fading up: a 34px bar bisecting an on-screen string, the same overprint defect
  // this file has now fixed five times. So the reveals are DERIVED from the rule instead.
  // A row appears once the rule's top edge has passed below its baseline and descender, so
  // no label can ever be under the bar. The schedule is unchanged where it matters: the five
  // reveals still complete at local 34/67/100/133/166 against the old 40/74/106/138/172, i.e.

// ============================================================ S13  THE STATUTE
//
// THE PAGE, REBUILT (2026-08-08 panel, all three judges, ranked first).
//
// The charge: this page holds from 103s to the end, about 17 percent of the runtime, it is
// the largest object on screen and it carries the film's central legal claim, and it was
// "flat unshaded grey/black placeholder bars under readable labels, beside plates that carry
// bevel, inner shading and drop shadow". Three things are fixed here and none of them is a
// threshold.
//
//   FORM. The cuts run the film's own devices now — see CutFace: a shadow into the opening,
//   a floor that opens toward the light, bevelled walls, a lit near lip, a contact shadow.
//
//   VALUE. A row is no longer a label over a bar. Each row carries the datum this whole
//   sequence is about, from c12b: how many times artificial intelligence appears in that
//   approved use. Four zeros and a one, and the one is amber and is the last row. The card
//   now ADDS UP to the plate above it ("APPEARS EXACTLY ONCE") instead of illustrating it.
//
//   DENOMINATOR. A judge's second point, and it is an accuracy point: c12b's claim is that
//   AI appears in one of TEN approved uses, and this page drew five rows with no denominator,
//   so the picture argued weaker than the record supports. The ten cannot be DRAWN — six of
//   them appear nowhere in out/dispatch/claims.json, and inventing six statutory categories
//   to fill a column would be exactly the failure this film is about. So the page is LABELLED
//   for what it is: TEN IN THE STATUTE / PARTIAL LIST, per c12b's own wording. The list no
//   longer reads as complete, and no string on it is one the record cannot carry.
//
// AND THE PAGE STOPS BELOW THE CROP LINE. It scanned up to an authored top of 372, which the
// content zoom carries to a rendered 272: at t=110.5s crop_safety measured the top border
// crossing y=420 at 0.953 structured, and by t=113s the border was off the square entirely.
// CARD_TOP - ROWTRAVEL is now checked against SAFE_TOP at build time.
//
// ...AND THE SCAN STOPS WHERE THE HEADLINE IS, WHICH IS WHAT PINS IT. The first pass of this
// fix put the page's travel at 170 and rendered it: at t=113s the "APPEARS EXACTLY ONCE"
// plate was lying across the top of APPROVED USES OF FUNDS. The plate cannot go higher (its
// own top is already within 11px of SAFE_TOP), so the page's fully-scanned top is pinned
// below it, and 136 is what that comes to with the header's own 66px to the title baseline
