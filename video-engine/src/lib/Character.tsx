// CHARACTER — the parameterized IGS-style person rig (the cast system).
// Draw space: local 300x520, feet at (150,500). Scenes place/scale/flip it.
// Every shape ink-outlined; torso/head carry shade + highlight tones; idle
// breath + blink built in (pass the frame). Poses/emotions/outfits are props,
// so one rig yields a whole cast that REACTS to the story.
//
// 2026-07-21 PARITY PASS (owner-approved, see config/dispatch_rubric.yaml

// staying strictly flat-vector SVG (no filters, no 3D, render cost flat) —
// real faces (iris + lids + drawn nose + ears + blush + hair shine, optional
// glasses), real hands (palm/thumb/finger grooves + sleeve cuffs), per-outfit
// fabric (suit lapels + pocket square, quilt tube shading, hem stitching),
// light-wrap (left-contour rim, under-chin AO, shoulder-joint AO, boot soles),
// on top of the articulated walk cycle + idle weight-shift/breath.

  // flow-critic's cosmetic note), not merely a hair apart.
  // phase MUST differ between two figures sharing a frame or their idle life reads as lockstep

  // that moves at all re-rolls both every frame. Scenes animate `x` — Ep0808 S7 passes

  // ---- LEGS: the same finish the rest of this rig already has (2026-08-08) --------------
  //
  // WHAT SHIPPED. Two straight rounded rectangles, one flat lit strip, one flat shade
  // strip, a boot glued to the bottom edge and no joint anywhere. Two judges sampled the
  // leg band independently at 62.2s and reported the same thing: no knee, no ankle, no
  // foot, no contact shadow, and an outline visibly lighter than the torso 40px above it,
  // which carries a 7px ink silhouette, a form gradient, a rim light, a hi-vis stripe and
  // a pocket seam. One figure at two finish levels, which the style charter puts
  // explicitly in scope.
  //
  // WHAT IT IS NOW. A leg built exactly the way sleeve() builds an arm: from a solved
  // JOINT CHAIN, with the silhouette DERIVED from the chain instead of drawn as a box.
  //
  //   THE ANKLE IS THE FIXED END. The chain is solved from a planted ankle upward, so a
  //   weight shift changes the KNEE and the boot does not move at all. The 18px boot-skate
  //   this file fixed once by hand is now prevented by construction, not by remembering.
  //
  //   A STANDING LEG IS NEVER LOCKED, AND IT IS ALSO NOT A NOODLE. The first cut of this
  //   solved the knee from a two-bone IK with THIGH+SHIN 7px longer than the hip-to-ankle
  //   span, which put the knee 15px forward of that line and rendered two S-curved rubber
  //   hoses. Looking at the frame is what caught it; the geometry was "correct" and the
  //   picture was worse than the rectangles it replaced. A standing leg's knee sits a few
  //   px proud of the hip-ankle line and the JOINT is read from the crease, the kneecap
  //   line and the calf, not from a bent silhouette. So the break is 4.5px at rest.
  //
  //   THE FREE LEG BENDS MORE THAN THE LOADED ONE. That is what shifting your weight
  //   between your feet actually looks like, and it is the lower half of the same event
  //   the pelvis tilt and the chest counter-rotation carry above.
