/**
 * BIOPROCESS — the library's FIRST CONTAINED LIVING PROCESS, and its first CONTROLLER.
 * ===================================================================================
 * NET-NEW 2026-08-09 ("The Method, Not The Metal", NSF award 2614749).
 *
 * REAL GAP, checked against ASSET_MANIFEST.md in full before a line was written. The shelf
 * carries an orbital eye, a seafloor ear, a ground ear, two aerial machines, an under-ice
 * swimmer, a bench-science family, a records and paper family, a civics rules kit, an
 * absence grammar, an arthropod, a piece of media, a clinical family, a machine-vision
 * layer and thirteen biomes. EVERY MACHINE ON IT PERCEIVES. Not one of them CONTROLS, and
 * nothing on it is a vessel with a process inside.
 *
 * That gap is exactly this story. NSF's abstract puts "reinforcement-learning controllers
 * within a bioprocess digital twin", and the film's own thesis is that the software never
 * looks at the microbe. A shelf whose entire machine vocabulary is eyes could not have drawn
 * that, and re-skinning an eye as a controller would have drawn the opposite of the point.

 * CellSurface — the microbe, drawn so the film cannot lie about it.
 *
 * THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT NOTE IN THIS RUN'S FACT-CHECK: Shewanella oneidensis does NOT
 * eat, digest, consume or breathe rare earths. It respires iron and manganese, and the rare
 * earth interaction is BIOSORPTION, meaning the atoms bind to the OUTSIDE of the cell. The
 * verified verbs are bind, stick, latch, adsorb.
 *
 * So the accuracy is built into the geometry rather than trusted to a caption. `bound`
 * atoms are placed on a radius strictly GREATER than the membrane's, they are drawn AFTER
 * the membrane so they can never be occluded by it, and `reject` drives an atom that
 * presses inward, dimples the wall, and is pushed straight back out. A scene physically
 * cannot use this component to show ingestion.
