/**
 * END CREDITS — the attribution the owner used to paste by hand, burned into the film.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-09, owner's request).
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every Dispatch owes three things to somebody: the music is CC BY 4.0 and the licence
 * requires attribution wherever the work is distributed, the claims are only checkable if
 * the sources travel with them, and the channel wants people to be able to find it. All
 * three were being pasted into a LinkedIn first comment by hand, every single time, which
 * meant they existed on exactly one of the surfaces the video reaches. A file posted to
 * TikTok, embedded on the site, or sent to anyone carried none of it.
 *
 * A judge raised the missing music credit as a HARD BLOCKER on 2026-08-09 and was right.
 * The fix that day was a one-line strap. This is the general version: credits ride in the
 * picture, so they cannot be forgotten and cannot be separated from the film.
 *
 * IT IS DATA, NOT COPY. Everything on this card comes from `episode_props.json.credits`,
 * which `build_scenes.py` derives from `out/dispatch/music_credit.json` and
 * `out/dispatch/sources.json`. Nothing here is typed per run, so it cannot drift from the
 * record the way a hand-pasted comment can, and `scripts/credits_check.py` fails the run if
 * the rendered strings stop matching those files.
 *
 * The card is deliberately plain: high contrast, nothing moving that has to be READ. It is
 * the one moment in a Dispatch that is not trying to hold attention, it is trying to be
 * legible on a phone and screenshot-able.
 *
 * AMENDED 2026-08-13 (round 7). That paragraph used to say "static ... no motion", and it was
 * a design decision the film could not actually afford: content_sag_check fails
 * 123.50s..134.50s continuous at a 0.0 percent floor, which is eleven seconds of frozen JPEG
 * across the entire tail of the film, and the panel separately kept marking the end card as
 * dead. So there is now exactly one moving thing, a slow bloom on the ground plane, under
 * every glyph. The original intent is preserved as written: nothing a reader has to parse
 * moves, contrast is untouched, and any single frame still screenshots clean.
