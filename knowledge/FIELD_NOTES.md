## 2026-07-13 — run 6 retro (Carousel No. 6, "The Interior's Power Math")

- **Shipped 8.69 vs 8.3** (9 slides, vector PDF 3.26MB), zero hard fails, 1 pixel round (all 9 reviewed; S2/S3/S4 had blocker/major issues, all fixed + re-verified) + 1 flow round (SHIP, 8.2) + 1 post-score fix. Story: GVEA's July 13 board vote on a second ~$120M LM6000 gas turbine, framed "Firm power, soft load" -- a member-owned Interior co-op asked to finance firm gas capacity on member debt while the AI loads that make firm power feel urgent (Air Force EULs at Eielson/Clear/JBER) are still proposals. Deliberate pivot to a flat editorial FIRM/SOFT type-weight ledger + one rendered turbine, after four straight energy/monitoring/robotics decks.
- **The winning frame was the essayist's, strengthened by the other two directors.** "Firm power, soft load" (a portable rule-of-thumb) beat "the megawatt mortgage" (data-journalist) and "the phantom load" (systems-illustrator); the phantom-load idea was GRAFTED in (the SOFT column drawn in drafting phantom-dashes), and all three converged on the rendered LM6000 object as the depth hero. Synthesis > any single pitch.
- **Fact-check recovered claims the fact-checker dropped on dead URLs.** The fact-checker returned 19 verified claims but dropped the GVEA fuel-spike (its guessed alaskasnewssource/ADN URLs 404'd). A quick showrunner re-fetch with the REAL URLs (gvea primary via search + alaskasnewssource + KUAC) recovered the +61%/$45.74/$2.50-to-$5.10 backdrop (c19-c24) that became the emotional core (S5). Lesson: when the fact-checker drops a claim for a fetch failure (not a falsehood), retry the URL yourself before abandoning a strong beat.
- **Honesty firewall as a DESIGN problem, not just a copy one.** The load-bearing S3 ("what the paper reports" vs "what the co-op says") FAILED the pixel critic because the attributed data-center panel rendered larger/brighter than GVEA's own words -- visual favoritism inverting the honesty point. Fix: identical panels (same top, min-height, plate, quote glyphs). New instinct logged (equalize-honesty-panels).
- **Rendered object hero needs a text scrim, not text-shadow.** S4's body copy over the akthree steel turbine dropped below 4.5:1 (pixel BLOCKER) despite a shadow; a Deep-Sea-Scrim DOM gradient behind the text column fixed it while keeping the object big. Also: the first lathe profile read as a propane bottle; a bell intake + casing seams + a rear exhaust stack + a control cabinet made it read as an industrial turbine package. Two new instincts (render-object-text-scrim; and reshape-for-silhouette). Weakest rubric criterion again = artwork craft (7): the turbine still reads slightly generic as a chrome vessel; parked as a reusable LM6000-specific object-hero detail kit.
- **The dividing-rule motif carried the whole argument.** A FIRM(solid)/SOFT(ghost) vertical rule that migrates per beat and SEALS into a gold "closed door" at synthesis (executive session) then splits open into the close question read as one evolving object across the filmstrip (flow critic confirmed motif + palette-arc). Generalizes to any two-sided / certain-vs-speculative story.
- **Recurring fixes that held:** fixed-width centered label boxes tripped the safe-zone gate on their BOX edges (S2); content-width nowrap fixed it (new instinct). Instrument-Serif-italic-only again false-FAILed render.py's upright-400 font probe; the offscreen upright-loader span cleared it (the parked 07-10 probe fix is now worth landing as a real engine change -- Phase 12 candidate).

## 2026-07-13 — craft refresh (run 6 pre-research pass)

- **"Bounce rate" is now named as an explicit tracked document-post signal** (dataslayer Feb 2026, digitallybugged 2026 guide): the algorithm reportedly reads whether a viewer swipes past slide 1, and a high slide-1-to-slide-2 dropoff suppresses reach. This is a sharper articulation of our existing "steepest drop is 1 to 2 / cover must earn the swipe" rule, not a new lever. Practical restatement for the directors room: the cover's ONLY job is to buy the second slide, and slide 2 must pay immediately (no agenda beat). Nothing to change in the gates.
- Everything else reconfirms current practice: documents remain the top organic format (~6.6% ER), saves ~5x a like / ~2x a comment in reach value, 8 to 10 slides and 15 to 20s dwell the save-optimal band. No doctrine change.

## 2026-07-12 — run 5 retro (Carousel No. 5, "First Machine to the Fire")

- **Shipped 8.54 vs 8.3** (9 slides, vector PDF 2.3MB), zero hard fails, 1 pixel round + confirmed fixes + 1 flow round. Story: Alaska as the world's proving ground for autonomous wildfire robots (XPRIZE Autonomous track finals via UAF ACUASI on a 1,000 sq km range; five finalists; September 2026 verdict). Deliberate break from four straight energy/infrastructure/monitoring decks.
- **The Dryad/XPRIZE story that collapsed in run 4 survived in run 5** because the frame changed: the deck is built on the VERIFIED structure (xprize.org roster, ACUASI/UAF partner, 1,000 km2, prize architecture, FAA test-site status), and Dryad's self-reported detect-and-suppress demo is one attributed data point (S6, "Dryad says" + NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED), never the thesis. The climax is the honest open verdict (S8), not the demo. Fact-check-before-select resolved the finalist count too: FIVE Autonomous finalists (Dryad's own "final three" contradicts xprize.org and was dropped).
- **New hero/motif that landed: the closing Autonomy Ring** — a discrete cyclic control-system loop (detect/decide/dispatch/douse) that doubles as an explicit N/4 progress counter and seals gold at the verdict. Flow critic caught that brightness-only arc increments read as a static logo; fix = dim (gray) unlit arcs + an explicit "N / 4" label. New instinct logged. Generalizes to any process/loop story.
- **Two honesty catches by the pixel critics** that qa.py can't see: S3 lit "fire-season" bars rendered gold after akpost (fixed to redder #E8531F to match the split bar and clear the gold budget), and S4's warm convergence point sat exactly on the Dryad row (favoritism for the one company featured later; moved above the roster, all five nodes equal). Both were composition/honesty, not machine-detectable.
- **Rendered akthree hero** (backlit quadcopter over fire-lit dusk) shipped with an AK3D fallback; weakest criterion (artwork craft, 7) is that it still reads slightly flat. A warm rim light from the key direction + a scale bump made it read as a quadcopter rather than a smear (new instinct). Parked for Phase 12: a reusable rim-light + profile-clarity helper for object heroes.
- Canvas-vs-DOM overprint recurred and was again caught only by eye (S5 loop arcs vs block plates, S8 body vs closed ring), not qa.py. Confirmed-instinct bumped.

---

## 2026-07-12 — craft refresh (run 5)

- Named, reusable frameworks drive SAVES on LinkedIn carousels (a coined "The N-Thing Method" reads as a portable thinking tool). Reinforces giving each deck a named thesis/frame on the cover, not just a headline. Consider a coined frame when the story has a clean structural spine.
- 8 to 10 slides remains the save-optimal band with roughly 15 to 20 seconds dwell; nothing here changes current practice. Consistency of the visual system across every slide (background, type, accent, grid) is repeated as the top design driver, which the constellation system already enforces.

---

## 2026-07-11 — THE 3D UPGRADE (maintainer-directed dev session, post run 4)

- **The 2D-to-3D leap landed.** Empirical probes overturned the standing "WebGL experimental"
  assumption: SwiftShader/ANGLE (Vulkan "Subzero") renders a full PBR frame (MeshStandardMaterial,
  2048px PCFSoft shadows, ACES, AA) at 2160x2700 in ~70ms in this container. Forum lore said 24-31s;
  measure, do not inherit. Four new committed benches: akthree (GPU PBR + procedural IBL + brand
  rigs/materials), aksdf (CPU SDF raymarcher for organic sculpted heroes), akpost (film-grade post:
  correct op order, IGN dither, masked grain, unsharp), akcolor (OKLCH ramps + gradient-map
  underpainting). TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY 87-90; DESIGN_DOCTRINE gained THE RENDERED LADDER; proof deck at
  examples/proof-3d (3 slides, qa PASS).
- **Two bugs the bench now encodes forever:** (1) three.js setPixelRatio must precede setSize or the
  backing store silently drops to 1x (all early probes were unknowingly 1080p); (2) a nested block
  comment in a JS header killed a module load with a bare "Unexpected token" page error; node --check
  everything committed.
- **Scene-authoring lessons from the proofs:** emissive tubes at tone-mapped exposure balloon into
  washed bands (keep emissive intensity <= ~2.5 and radius small); SDF carved tunnels go near-black
  without an indirect floor; light-bottomed renders need dark-ink footer furniture (contrast gate
  caught it).
- **Enforcement wired (same session, maintainer prompt):** qa.py now FAILS dead canvases (near-uniform
  pixels = failed GL frame) and sub-1.5x canvas backing; rubric + pixel-critic enforce THE RENDERED
  LADDER; master prompt names the gates. The dead-canvas gate's first reconstruction run caught a real
  bug: probing webglOK on the render target froze the context without preserveDrawingBuffer and blinded
  the sampler. Probes get throwaway canvases, forever.
- **Parked, high-value next steps:** matcap + G-buffer deferred pass for ak3d (per-pixel normals,
  Blender-clay look without GPU); APCA text-contrast auto-solver; saliency-map focal-hierarchy QA
  check (Itti-Koch downsample: assert the intended focal wins); strata-texture helper (run 4 retro);
  llvmpipe lane (--use-angle=gl) as a SwiftShader hedge if Chromium's deprecation ever lands.

## 2026-07-11 — run 4 retro (Carousel No. 4, "The Cook Inlet Gas Machine")

- **Shipped 8.90 vs 8.3** (9 slides, vector PDF 2.94MB), zero hard fails, 1 pixel round + 1 flow round.
  Story: the July 10 RCA denial of Enstar's $240M Cook Inlet gas STORAGE prudency request, framed as
  Alaska's supply ceiling meeting AI's gigawatt demand. NEW hero: a subsurface engineering cutaway
  ("the gas machine") on a panorama-spine, with a reservoir-lens state machine and a valve open->shut motif.
- **Fact-check-before-select earned its keep again**: the two topically-fresher candidates collapsed under
  scrutiny (Dryad XPRIZE wildfire = company-PR-only sourcing + vague AK site; MONTIS avalanche drone = NOT AI,
  it is remote-piloted, and "first DOT"/"replaces helicopters" were unsupported). Ordering claims before
  selection saved the run from building a deck on PR. A well-sourced important story beat two novel thin ones.
- **The canvas-vs-DOM-text blind spot recurred at scale** and is now the dominant defect class: qa.py PASSED a
  deck where in-section DOM readouts and canvas labels overlapped body text and sat on the low-contrast ochre
  band (S2 legend on homes, S3 curve labels on body, S4 readouts ~1.5:1 on ochre, S6 SUSPENDED, S7 flag-label
  mash, S8 context on ochre). Fixes: a `.plate-dark` CSS class for DOM readouts, canvas knockout chips for
  canvas labels, and capping body max-width so the body ENDS in the sky zone. Two new instincts logged.
- **State-change motif needs geometry, not rotation**: the flow critic found the 8-spoke valve looked identical
  rotated; an amber lock-bar across the hub made "shut" read at 432px. Motif carriers must change SHAPE.
- **Honesty guardrails held**: c10/c11 (op-ed rate stats) kept off every slide; c12 (2027) used once, tagged
  op-ed; c13 quoted verbatim with the "different units, not one sum" guardrail directly under the S8 bars; no
  derived MW anywhere. The Bcf-vs-GW adjacency (all three directors flagged it) is defused on-slide.
- **Curly-apostrophe false-positive, again**: three pixel critics flagged "smart quotes"; source grep showed
  ZERO curly/dash bytes on all 9 slides (straight U+0027/U+0022). Fraunces/Manrope render straight apostrophes
  with a slight curl. Always verify quote/dash violations at SOURCE level (run-1 lesson, re-confirmed).
- **Weakest criterion = artwork craft (7)**: flat strata gradient bands, plain elliptical lenses, and S1/S9
  lower-third dead zones. PARKED for Phase 12 as a reusable strata-texture/rim-light helper (within-band fbm
  mottling + lens rim-light + dead-zone fill) so every future cutaway/landscape deck gets it for free.
- Docket: added the Enstar Cook Inlet gas storage item (RCA denial). GVEA (Jul 13) and AKLNG (Jul 16) re-fetch
  failed (429/503/403) and were carried forward; both resolve within days and are worth a hard re-check next run.

## 2026-07-11 — Phase 12 (automation retro + frontier scan)

- **APPLIED — knockout-plate canvas-label helper (`assets/js/aklabel.js`).** The durable form of this run's
  dominant hand-fix. `AK.canvasLabel(cx,x,y,text,{color,align})` draws an opaque plate under the glyphs so a
  canvas label's contrast depends on (text, plate) only, not the strata beneath; `AK.rectsOverlap` keeps stacked
  in-scene labels from merging. Verified: same text/colour that shipped at ~1.9:1 on ochre reads ~8.5:1 with the
  helper; ENSTAR/HILCORP that merged into "ENSTAHILCORP" now sit on separate plates. Opt-in; no gate touched.
- **PARKED — canvas-text-aware QA gate.** The real gap is that canvas-DRAWN text is invisible to EVERY gate
  (text_collisions/contrast_estimate/busy-art tripwire all walk render.py's DOM text_nodes; canvas ink has no
  node). A gate that could see it needs OCR or stroke/edge heuristics that would false-positive on dense
  sectional artwork (strata hatching, valve wheels, curves). Not a safely-boundable ~100-line change. Revisit
  only with a bounded discriminator (e.g. require in-scene labels to register a DOM "shadow rect" the gate can
  read, turning canvas labels back into checkable boxes). Meanwhile `aklabel.js` removes the incentive to draw
  raw canvas text. Recommended to maintainer: a contrast floor for `data-decorative` labels over light bands, or
  a house rule that in-scene labels use `AK.canvasLabel` (both are threshold/policy = maintainer's call).
- **PARKED (frontier, procedural-art scan) — strata-texture / rim-light craft helper.** Weakest rubric this run
  = artwork craft (7): flat gradient bands, plain elliptical lenses, dead lower-thirds. The scan confirmed the
  math is ALREADY committed in noise.js (`AK.fbm2/fbm3/warp2`); Quilez's fbm article gives the geological
  parameter (H=1, gain=0.5, ~5-6 octaves) for rock-like spectra, and relief needs only a cheap gradient-of-fbm
  rim-light. So the parked helper is a thin painterly LAYER over existing primitives, not new deps: (1) clip to
  a band path, paint low-alpha fbm mottling (gain 0.5, 5 oct) tinted +/- 8% luminance; (2) rim-light a filled
  lens/shape by stroking its upper-left arc with a lighter tint at ~0.5 alpha; (3) fill dead lower-thirds with a
  very low-alpha warp2 field. Held because it is a SECOND assets/js change the day after a 4-upgrade day; land
  it next run as the sole improvement slot, verified by rendering an opt-in demo slide. Sources:

## 2026-07-11 — craft refresh (run 4 pre-research pass)

- **Named, reusable frameworks drive saves (new actionable handle).** Multiple 2026 carousel roundups (Oktopost, Morphica, SocialPilot) converge that the highest-save decks hand the reader a NAMED, portable thinking tool ("The 3-C Framework", "The RICE Method") they can carry and reuse, not just a story. For us that means: when the story allows, give the deck ONE named lens or rule-of-thumb the reader keeps (a coined term, a 3-part test, a checklist), stated once and reinforced on the close. Save-value is our whole strategy, so this is a real lever, not fluff. Does not change gates.
- Platform numbers otherwise hold: documents remain the top organic format (~4.5% ER, ~45% over video, ~6x reach of link posts, ~3x save rate of text), 4:5 portrait, 6-10 slides the sweet spot, caption under ~150 words driving INTO the deck, personal-profile edge persists (aftercare note for the human, not a design change).

## 2026-07-10 — parked frontier + minor candidates (upgrade-engineer, editorial-dataviz/cartography scan)

- **Concentric-radial-rings seasonal small multiple (parked technique).** A
  recent Bloomberg guide wraps the calendar year into a ring per small chart;
  concentric rings each encode a variable (weekly share, avg high temp,
  precipitation) and a seasonal peak reads as a bulge. Portable to offline,
  seeded, static SVG/Canvas. Strong fit for any AK deck with a seasonal
  quantity (fishing openers, daylight swing, eruption cadence, PFD timing).
  TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY candidate, not an engine change; promote when a deck's
  story lands on a cyclical/seasonal number.
  Source: https://www.anychart.com/blog/2026/07/10/data-graphics-pull-their-weight/
- **Data-journalist map design space (parked reference).** "How do Data
  Journalists Design Maps to Tell Stories?" analyzes 462 journalistic maps from
  five outlets into an eight-dimension design space (article properties + map
  visual/interactive features) plus common editorial rationales. A checklist
  for the treatment-directors when a deck goes cartographic (framing/crop,
  annotation, focus+context, projection intent). Reference, not code.
  Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10903
- **Style-aware font probe (parked minor fix).** render.py's font-loaded check
  builds its `document.fonts.check()` spec as weight + size + family with NO
  font-style, so an italic-only display face (Instrument Serif italic this run)
  false-FAILs the upright-400 probe; self-corrected in-slide by loading both
  faces. Fix: pass the element's computed font-style into the check spec so the
  probe tests the face actually used. Bounded and correct, but it edits a hard
  gate and was not defect-forced this run, so it was held (daily cadence favors
  0-1 upgrades and two reactive fixes spent the budget). Land it a day the
  budget is open; verify no shipped slide's font check changes verdict.

## 2026-07-10 — run 3 retro (Carousel No. 3, "The Machine That Hears a Mountain Think")

- Story: AVO volcano-monitoring AI (VOISS-Net + VolcSARvatory) with the live Great Sitkin
  eruption peg (3 volcanoes elevated at once, Jul 3 AVO update). First instrument-register deck
  (Space Grotesk + JBMono + obsidian/phosphor); evolving seismic-trace conductor motif.
- **Canvas-over-DOM-text is a QA blind spot**: qa.py checks DOM line boxes only, so the S3
  flightpath arc crossed body copy and machine QA PASSED it; pixel critics caught it. New
  instinct logged: route canvas paths around text blocks at PLAN time and make critics check
  canvas-vs-text explicitly.
- **Motif connective tissue**: the flow critic found the conductor trace read on ~6 of 9 frames;
  adding low-alpha enter/exit strokes on S3/S6/S7 stitched the film together. Lesson: a motif's
  TRANSFORMATION states are not enough; draw the connections.
- Fact-checker corrections that mattered: $6.3M is a shared NASA award (7 projects), Great Sitkin
  is 5,708 ft (not 5,709), Shishaldin elevation unfetchable so the Arc Index shows "not listed"
  (honest omission beats invention).
- fitText everywhere prevented all wrap-collisions this run (0 vs 4 last run); the recurring
  defect class appears closed by the committed helper.

## 2026-07-10 — craft refresh (run 3 pre-research pass)

- **Personal profile carousels earn ~63% more engagement than company-page carousels** (dataslayer/linkboost 2026). Alaska.Ai posts from a page; the human should consider cross-posting the deck from a personal profile, or at minimum knows the page handicap is real. Aftercare-relevant, not a design change.
- **Buffer 2026 State of Social Media (52M+ posts)** reports a median LinkedIn carousel engagement rate far above single-format medians; the wide spread confirms carousels as the highest-ceiling format but says nothing new to change the build. Documents still #1 (~6.6% ER convergent).
- **Year-over-year platform contraction is steeper than the mid-2025 read**: views ~-50%, engagement ~-25%, follower growth ~-59% (dataslayer Feb 2026). Reinforces judging against OUR trailing median and the keepable-artifact strategy over applause. Nothing to change in the machine.

## 2026-07-09 — run 2 retro (Carousel No. 2, "One River, Two Ways to Count It")

- **Shipped 8.83 vs 8.3** (9 slides, vector PDF 4.94MB), zero hard fails, one pixel-refinement
  round + a passing flow round. Story: the Wood River AI drone + computer-vision salmon-counting
  pilot vs Bristol Bay's 70-year hand-count towers. Full worker roster ran (6 scouts, fact-checker,
  3 treatment-directors, copywriter, 5 pixel critics, flow critic, scorer) with no usage-limit
  degradation this time; parallel critics earned their keep (caught 3 things machine_qa passed).
- **Fact-checker saved us from two errors the scouts carried**: ADF&G is NOT a project partner
  ("isn't directly involved at this stage"), and the run forecast is 44.05M not 41.5M. Re-fetching
  every URL and dropping the unverifiable (BBRSDA dates, exact GVEA cents/kWh, the 4:30pm deadline
  time) kept the deck honest. Lesson reinforced: trust only fetched text, never scout summaries.
- **Honesty as the edge, not a hedge**: the deck's whole thesis is that the AI is UNPROVEN (in
  training). The gold UNPROVEN scorecard cell, the "CONF 0.00 UNTRAINED" cover tag, and "every
  number the fleet trusts came from a human hand" scored best-in-class story-art fusion (9). A
  thin-but-true frame beat a hyped one.
- **Display-headline wrap is the new slide-3 defect class**: four headlines (S1/S4/S7/S8) wrapped
  an extra line into the body and machine_qa-FAILED as overprint, all because the headline
  container was narrower than its longest line. New instinct logged; fix is full-width or downsize
  + verify line count pre-render.
- **Empty lower thirds** cost a craft point. Several slides left the bottom third dead. New
  instinct: budget the lower third (readout / caption / anchor / intentional quiet), do not default.
- **Canvas ctx.filter="blur()" works headless** for a discrete DOF foreground pass (S5 reeds);
  keep the focal layer outside the filtered save/restore. Cheap, reliable repoussoir blur.
- **NEW technique invented**: SpawningSockeye (added to TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY) -- a side-profile
  spawning sockeye SVG icon (humped dorsal, kype, olive-green head, forked tail) that reads as
  salmon at 432px and doubles as the deck's data anchor (the fish wears both counting marks).
- Story note: the drone pilot has NO published accuracy number yet; when the team reports one
  (or ADF&G formally joins), that is a strong UPDATE angle. GVEA July 13 turbine vote, STAK July 17
  comment close, and AKLNG July 16 vote all resolve within days -- docket-worthy follow-ups.

## 2026-07-09 — craft refresh (run 2 pre-research pass)

- Platform numbers hold, nothing new vs run 1's craft note: documents still the
  #1 format (6.6 to 7.0% ER, ~5x reach of static, 12.92% of all saves), 8-10
  slides, 15-20s dwell the ranking signal. (dataslayer/contentdrips/postunreel 2026.)
- **Echogram as a portable visual language (NEW craft handle)**: imaging-sonar
  fish counting compresses hundreds of sonar video frames into a single
  "echogram" band (time on one axis, range on the other, each fish a bright
  streak). This is a real, drawable, information-dense motif for any AK
  fisheries-AI deck: a seeded streak field where streak COUNT encodes the fish
  number and density encodes run strength, with a flat 2D axis. Portable to
  offline Canvas. (arxiv 2502.05129 "Counting Fish with Temporal Representations
  of Sonar Video"; arxiv 2505.06637 multimodal foundation AI for wild salmon in
  Indigenous rivers.) Parked as a technique candidate; only used if the story lands there.

## 2026-07-08 — run 1 retro (Carousel No. 1, "Four Rooms, One Open Door")

- **Shipped 8.64 vs 8.3** (9 slides, vector PDF 10.74MB) after one revision
  cycle. Round 0 scored 6.9: the scorer caught a slide-3 DOM text overlap
  (body line over a bar label) that machine QA passed — the
  machine-qa-is-not-taste instinct, confirmed the hard way.
- **DEGRADED run**: a session usage limit blocked ALL worker subagents
  mid-run (treatment directors, copywriter, pixel critic, flow critic).
  Showrunner authored the treatment/copy and self-reviewed; the objective
  gates (render QA, caption lint) and the scorer (which recovered later)
  still ran. Fallback held, but solo review missed a collision the scorer
  caught: parallel critics are not optional at full quality.
- **d3 zoom trap (new instinct)**: fitExtent to a small lon/lat bbox
  polygon renders a giant fill disc + mis-scaled map. Manual zoom (baseline
  full-state fit, then scale x zoom and re-translate onto the target) with
  a STROKE-ONLY coastline is the reliable recipe (slides 2 and 7).
- **data-decorative does not inherit**: mark the leaf text element (span,
  b, appended SVG text), not the parent div.
- **pypdf/cryptography panic**: the container's Debian cryptography 41
  rust binding panics on import, killing the vector PDF path;
  `pip install --user --upgrade cryptography` fixes it. Consider adding to
  bootstrap.sh.
- Scorer false-positive to remember: serif fonts render straight U+0027 as
  a typographic apostrophe glyph; verify quote characters with grep at the
  SOURCE level before treating as a hard fail.
- Story note: the STAK docket (ADL 422741) final decision lands after Jul
  17 — next run should check it for an update angle; Bristol Bay AI
  sockeye counting is the parked runner-up (claims c64-c77, fully
  verified).

## 2026-07-08 — craft refresh (run 1 pre-research pass)

- **360Brew is live as THE ranker** (LinkedIn Engineering, ~Mar 2026):
  distribution now runs on meaning/intent matching, not keywords. On-slide
  vector text and a topically explicit caption directly feed ranking;
  reinforces the vector-text hard gate. (dataslayer.ai 2026 algorithm
  review.)
- **AuthoredUp 3M-post study (Mar 2025 to Feb 2026)**: documents earn 39%
  more reach / 30% more engagement than the average post; documents are
  12.92% of all saves (2.6x their content share); only 4.88% of creators
  post documents regularly. Format edge persists. (contentdrips 2026-07-01.)
- **Q1 2026 softening**: carousel reach declining quarter over quarter
  while infographic-style posts hit 28.6% of top-1% posts. The keepable
  data-slide mandate is now the growth edge, not a nice-to-have.
- Mid-2026 "authenticity update": engagement bait, pods, and link spam
  penalized harder; polls effectively dead (0.07% ER). Nothing to change
  for us; confirms educational + native strategy.

## 2026-07-08 — framework build (engine smoke test lessons)

- **Grain economics**: full-frame feTurbulence grain rasterizes to a 10-40MB
  incompressible bitmap in the printed PDF. Always `AK.grainTile()` as a
  repeating background. (Encoded in TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY #2 and noise.js docs.)
- **Vector text survives blend modes**: Chromium's print engine keeps HTML/
  SVG text as vector even under mix-blend-mode overlays — but canvas text
  always rasterizes. Text in DOM/SVG, art in canvas. (Engine SKILL.md.)
- **`#map svg { display: block }`** — inline SVG baseline space overflowed
  the page by ~5px; the engine's body_overflow gate caught it. Always
  display:block full-bleed SVGs.
- **AlbersUsa inversion is a trap**: us-atlas TopoJSON is pre-projected and
  the inversion params are not recoverable reliably. We committed genuinely
  unprojected sources instead (Natural Earth 10m state outline via
  world-atlas; plotly unprojected counties for the 29 boroughs). Winding
  must satisfy the d3 spherical convention — rewind any ring whose
  geoArea > π.
- **3D composition must be computed, not eyeballed**: horizonY =
  cy + tan(−pitch)·f; a peak d units above the camera at distance D lands
  (d/D)·f px above the horizon. First two terrain attempts buried the
  range in the bottom 15% of frame. (Math now in ak3d.js header.)
- **Machine QA passed a slide the eye failed** (terrain crammed low, spec
  row colliding with ridge): objective gates catch errors, only pixel
  critics catch composition. Both layers are mandatory.
- **Simultaneous-contrast illusion**: bright strokes bounding a dark region
  make it read lighter than an identical fill elsewhere. Sample pixels
  before declaring a fill bug (we chased a phantom for four bisections).
- **Contrast estimator limits**: qa.py's bbox-median method under-detects
  text over busy varied art. The pixel critic must check worst-case
  contrast visually; the estimator is a tripwire only.

## 2026-07-08 — patterns adopted from the GitHub scout pass

- Instincts ledger (ECC pattern): ledger/instincts.json, confidence-scored
  lessons injected into future runs. Prune < 0.5 confidence after 8 runs.
- Variance dials + anti-repetition (taste-skill pattern): in the dossier
  header + artwork ledger.
- Claims-file fact-checking (Loki shape): claims.json with atomic claims,
  evidence URL + verbatim quote each; slides carry claim-ids.
- Completion gate (planning-with-files pattern): out/<run>/run_state.json
  phases must all be "done" with artifacts existing before merge/delivery.
- Critic text transcription (OCR-wave pattern, no deps): pixel critics
  transcribe every visible word from the PNG and diff against the dossier
  copy — catches font fallback, tofu, truncation that DOM checks miss.
- Candidates parked for later: microsoft/flint-chart (chart spec language),
  pyiqa (BRISQUE gate; heavy torch dep), meodai/heerich (SVG voxel mode),
  self-hosted Postiz (publish automation), pretext (text layout lib).

## 2026-07-09 — parked frontier + friction candidates (typography scan)

- **Variable-font WIDTH-axis fitting (parked).** Archivo and Unbounded carry
  a variable `wdth` axis; fit-to-width.js binary-searches the width axis
  (not just font-size) to fit a line, preserving optical size and cap-height
  while narrowing letterforms. Would complement AK.fitText (fit wdth first,
  then font-size) for headlines where shrinking type reads as timid.
  Not bounded enough to land in one daily upgrade slot; revisit when a deck
  needs a wide poster headline held at a fixed size.

- **Pre-flight colon lint (parked friction fix).** scripts/site_build.py
  refuses prose colons on emitted pages; run 2026-07-09 hit it twice (a
  docket history note, the first_comment article-title colon) and had to
  rephrase at SHIP time. A cheap lint over ledger notes / emitted copy run
  earlier in the pipeline would surface it before ship. The gate is correct
  and must not weaken; this only moves the catch earlier. Bound it to the
  same colon rule site_build already enforces before implementing.

## 2026-07-12 — parked frontier candidates (accessibility / PDF scan)

- **Per-slide alt text surfaced in the Gmail draft (parked, highest-value).**
  In 2026 LinkedIn has no native organic image carousel; the only swipeable
  format is a document post (PDF/PPTX/DOCX), which LinkedIn RE-RENDERS into
  images. That means embedded PDF tags do NOT carry to the LinkedIn viewer;
  the reach/accessibility lever is the ALT TEXT typed into LinkedIn's upload
  UI per slide. The machine could emit a short factual alt string per slide
  (from the dossier + transcribed copy) and print them in the Gmail draft so
  the maintainer pastes them at upload. Parked because it needs a copy source
  of truth (dossier vs pixel-critic transcription) and gmail_draft.py work
  beyond one bounded daily slot; not a defect. Sources:

  https://socialbee.com/blog/how-to-post-linkedin-carousels/
- **PDF /Lang + Marked flag in assemble.py (parked, near-bounded).** The
  public-site PDF (alaskaaihq.com) has no document language set; a screen
  reader guesses pronunciation. assemble.py already writes Title/Author/
  Creator metadata (lines 96-97) but no /Lang or /Marked. Setting
  writer's viewer prefs / catalog /Lang "en-US" is a ~2-line pypdf change
  that helps the site PDF (LinkedIn rasterizes, so no LinkedIn effect). Held
  because it touches the vector-PDF writer path and must be verified to not
  disturb the vector-text output the hard-fail gate checks; low value, so it
  waits for a slot where assemble.py is already open. Full PDF/UA tagging
  (structure tree, per-image alt, reading order) is a large unbounded effort
  on vector-drawn pages with no semantic DOM and is NOT recommended. Source:
